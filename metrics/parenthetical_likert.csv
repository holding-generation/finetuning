"Defendant’s attorney then told the jury that Lonnie Smith, a welding instructor, would testify that defendant discussed with him plans to make a lamp stand using the shotgun, and that defendant agreed to sell the shotgun to Robert Sandoval, an undercover agent, because the gun was worthless except as a part of defendant’s welding project. In opening statements the jury heard defendant’s version of how he came into possession of the shotgun and his theory of defense. After he repeated that he did not view it as a firearm, the district court sustained the government’s objection. Defendant then presented the testimony of defendant’s counsel in a related state court case, who testified that the firearm was inoperable at the state preliminary hearing. The government then presented testimony by Glenn Alexander, the detective who received the gun from Sandoval and logged it into the evidence room. The district court then sustained the government’s objection to defense counsel’s further questioning about whether the gun worked. Defendant took the stand and testified he concluded that the gun was not a firearm because it was broken, and he stored it as junk. After he repeated that he did not view it as a firearm, the district court sustained the government’s objection. United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.1994) (gun inoperable due to broken firing pin still designed or readily converted to expel projectile so still firearm under § 922), cert. Defendant’s proposed jury instructions state an “ignorance of the law” defense, a defense which is “easily rejected.” United States v. Capps, 77 F.3d 350, 353 (10th Cir.) On redirect defendant testified that he did not believe it was a firearm because he thought a firearm had “to be able to do bodily harm to a person.” Id. The district court properly excluded the “good faith” jury instruction suggesting that ignorance of the law was a defense, and the corresponding evidence. Lonnie Smith testified that defendant had planned to use the old gun as a lamp stand. § 5861(d), based on defendant’s possession of a machine gun, required that government prove defendant knew of the features of his gun that brought it -within the scope of that act). Defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The district court did not allow defense counsel to introduce defendant’s drawings concerning the design of the table with the shotgun. Also, when the government produced evidence that the gun could be repaired (e.g., “easily converted”) to expel a projectile, see IV R. 91-93 (Sandoval); V R. 143-48 (Alexander), defendant was allowed to cross-examine Sandoval before the government's objection to his question to Alexander on the issue was sustained. In Staples the Court determined that this knowledge requirement meant that the government had to prove that the defendant knew his weapon could shoot or be readily restored to shooting automatically. Further, even the proffered testimony of the defense’s investigator indicated he was able to make the gun work. Defendant asserts the court erroneously excluded evidence that he did not think the gun could expel a projectile or readily be converted to do so. United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.1994) (gun inoperable due to broken firing pin still designed or readily converted to expel projectile so still firearm under § 922), cert. ",holding that a good faith belief that a firearm is inoperable is not a viable defense to 18 usc  922g," Holding: Defendant could not claim the gun was not a firearm due to its inoperability, as it was still designed or readily converted to expel a projectile, making it a firearm under § 922.",4,"  holding that the gun in question was still a firearm under federal law, even though it was inoperable due to a broken firing pin, because it was designed or readily converted to expel a projectile.",4,holding that the district court properly excluded the good faith jury instruction suggesting that ignorance of the law was a defense and the corresponding evidence,3,holding that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the elements of the firearm that he was liable for,2
"Specifically, all claims against Royce Homes, L.P. related to construction defects in the construction of the property itself (“Construction Defect Claims”) as set forth in Plaintiffs’ and Intervenors’ First Supplemental Petition in Response to DWM Holdings’ Special Exceptions and Pursuant to Court Order, shall remain pending and are abated for arbitration. Neither the homeowners nor Royce Homes filed the arbitration proceedings contemplated in the settlement agreement. That provision stated, “Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related directly or indirectly but not limited to ... the construction or repair of the home ... shall be settled by arbitra-tions [conducted by CAS].” On February 11, 1999, disgruntled residents of the Green Valley Estates filed suit against their homebuilders, the neighborhood developer, and various other entities. On May 6, 2004, the homeowners filed their eleventh amended petition against Royce Homes and its general partner, Hammersmith, on the severed claims. This original lawsuit sought to establish a separate homeowner’s association and to address claims surrounding the creation of the subdivision and construction defects. This agreement expressly excluded the homeowners’ construction defect claims against Royce Homes and Hammersmith. 107,892 contains the entire agreement between the parties and the terms hereof are contractual and not mere recitals. In response to the homeowners’ application to appoint an arbitrator under the TAA, on August 8, 2006, Royce Homes filed a motion to enforce the arbitration agreements signed by all fifteen of the homeowners in purchasing them homes, which provided that CAS should act as arbitrator, and it filed a motion to reconsider the appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator. On August 17, 2006, the five homeowners who had not joined the original motion to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the TAA moved the trial court for appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator for their claims. He further informed counsel that unless the [homeowners] made applications for limited warranty claims, only, through Home Buyer’s Warranty, Inc., the purported administrator of an alleged warranty program in which the builder Royce Homes, L.P., attempted to enroll Movants at the time of their respective closings, and Home Buyers Warranty, Inc. and Royce Homes, L.P., made an application to CAS, CAS would not arbitrate these five claims. In July 2006, attorneys for the homeowners prepared applications and helped the homeowners make arrangements to pay the application fee to CAS “in order to have it immediately appoint its names arbitrator and enter a scheduling order” to avoid the trial court’s order for dismissal. Despite being informed that the claims in this dispute were being submitted to arbitration pursuant to the agreements reached in this case and upon the Court’s order severing the fifteen remaining claims, Cardell Wade informed counsel for Movants that CAS still refused to accept a request of demand for arbitration from the Movants and that CAS would refuse to act as arbitrator even if ordered by this Court to do so, unless the homebuilder, Royce Homes, L.P., and Home Buyers Warranty, Inc., requested CAS to do so. Royce Homes argued that because all fifteen homeowners with pending construction defect claims had signed arbitration provisions in their Home Buyer’s Warranty agreements and some of the homeowners had signed arbitration agreements in the Espree Arbitration Ad-dendums, and because both required arbitration to be conducted by CAS, the arbitration should be conducted by CAS. The motion further stated: Then, on August 14, 2006, CAS’s representative, Cardell Wade, for no apparent reason, informed counsel for [the homeowners] that CAS would no longer accept the role as arbitrator under these contracts. On August 22, 2006, Royce Homes filed a response to the remaining five homeowners’ motion to have Tom McDonald appointed as arbitrator. Also on August 17, 2006, Royce Homes filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that Royce Homes had sought to compel the homeowners to arbitration with CAS since it had first made an appearance in the case and that, under both the TAA and the FAA, the trial court was required to appoint the arbitrator specified in the arbitration agreements. On August 22, 2006, the trial court signed an order denying Royce Homes’ motions to enforce the arbitration agreement and to reconsider the appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator. On April 12, 2007, Royce Homes filed a motion with McDonald, the court-appointed arbitrator, again seeking to enforce the arbitration provisions designating CAS as arbitrator, or alternatively, implementing CAS procedures. Royce Homes attached the affidavit of Cardell Wade, which stated: The CAS Rules for the Arbitration of Home Warranty Disputes ... require that the Parties agree to utilize the CAS Rules either through a separate agreement or as part of a warranty program. On February 29, 2008, the trial court entered a final judgment confirming the full amount of the arbitration award. The motion further stated: Then, on August 14, 2006, CAS’s representative, Cardell Wade, for no apparent reason, informed counsel for [the homeowners] that CAS would no longer accept the role as arbitrator under these contracts.

Scope of Arbitrator’s Powers Royce Homes argues that the arbitration should have been conducted by CAS, or in the alternative, that it should have been conducted following CAS procedures. Failure to Appoint CAS Arbitrator The homeowners contend that, even if the settlement agreement did not supersede the previous arbitration agreements, those arbitration provisions were not binding on the arbitration of the construction defect claims. However, the settlement agreement expressly excepted the construction defect claims of the homeowners who are currently parties to this appeal from the settlement agreement and provided that those claims remained pending and were “abated for arbitration.” The settlement agreement specifically contemplated that the claims would be either settled or arbitrated, but it did not specify a method of arbitration. Corp., 814 F.2d at 1329 (holding section 5 substitution process can also be used when parties reach impasse in making their selection). Corp., 972 S.W.2d at 64-65 (holding that section 5 substitution process should be invoked by trial court when some “mechanical breakdown in the arbitrator selection process” occurs); Pac. Therefore, the trial court was justified in invoking the substitution process set out in section 5 of the FAA. The affidavits of both the homeowners’ counsel and of Cardell Wade of CAS reflect that arbitration through CAS could not be conducted unless the homeowners filed their construction defect complaints against Royce Homes through HBW, which the homeowners had declined to do, citing the inapplicability of the warranty agreements to their claims. We hold that, while the Settlement Agreement does constitute an agreement to submit the construction' defect claims to arbitration, it does not contain a final and complete expression of all the terms the parties had agreed upon, specifically, the method of arbitration, which the parties had previously agreed should be conducted by CAS. .Royce Homes states that the trial court issued an order staying the litigation of the construction defect claims pending arbitration. Conclusion We affirm the judgment of the trial court. We overrule Royce Homes’ third issue. Royce Homes also points out that the parties' attorneys signed an agreed order to enforce the arbitration agreement in the warranties, but this order was never signed by the trial court and is undated. Therefore, the trial court was justified in invoking the substitution process set out in section 5 of the FAA. We overrule Royce Homes’ first and second issue. We have already held that the FAA applies to this case. .Royce Homes states that the trial court issued an order staying the litigation of the construction defect claims pending arbitration. . . . .",holding that common law grounds such as manifest disregard of law and gross mistake were not valid grounds for vacatur of arbitration award as hall street forecloses any common law grounds for vacatur," Holding that the balance between costs and benefits comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings, specifically since all claims against Royce Homes were abated for arbitration, and the arbitrator's authority is defined by the contract containing the arbitration clause and the issues actually submitted to arbitration.",3,"  Holding: The trial court did not err in invoking the substitution process set out in section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to appoint an arbitrator in this case.

"The Presentence Report that the court subsequently received stated that the maximum sentence was “life imprisonment, with a mandatory minimum of 15 years, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. The court accepted the guilty plea and ordered a Pre-sentence Investigation. Thereafter, Powell entered into a written plea agreement. The PSI also stated “[i]f a term of imprisonment is imposed, the Court may impose a term of supervised release of not more than five years, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. In that agreement, the government stipulated that his “offense level is 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. The court imposed that sentence without ever formally ruling upon Powell’s motion for a downward departure based upon the conditions of his presentence detention. § 924(e). For the purposes of this appeal, we will assume that the court’s sentence to the suggested guideline range constituted an implicit denial of Powell’s motion for a downward departure. However, Powell’s sentence included a five year term of supervised release as allowed, under 18 U.S.C. As noted above, Powell’s written plea agreement expressly stated that the court could not impose more than three years of supervised release. In Mummert, as here, the defendant appealed the district court’s failure to grant a requested downward departure following a guilty plea. In United States v. Mummert we explained our jurisdiction to review a district court’s denial of a motion for departure. We must decide if the district court erred in failing to address Powell’s request for a downward departure based on substandard conditions of confinement. United States v. Mummert, 34 F.3d 201, 205 (3d Cir.1994). As noted above, Powell’s written plea agreement expressly stated that the court could not impose more than three years of supervised release. However, Powell’s sentence included a five year term of supervised release as allowed, under 18 U.S.C. Supervised release “is a deprivation of some portion of one’s liberty imposed as a punitive measure for a bad act.” United States v. Dozier, 119 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.1997). Mustafa argued that the sentencing court erred in not inquiring into promises that had been made in relation to the change of plea. Perhaps because of this seemingly uniform approach, the government urges us to adopt a blanket rule that “a failure to explain a supervised release term at a Rule 11 hearing is harmless error if the term of incarceration imposed, combined with the term of supervised release imposed, is less than the maximum sentence [the defendant was aware of].” Government’s br. In United States v. Cleary, 46 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.1995), we held that a habeas petitioner under 28 U.S.C. Powell contends that he is entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement or, in the alternative, withdrawal of his guilty plea. Mustafa is distinguishable from the case at bar because here the government affirmatively misled Powell during the plea colloquy and in the guilty plea agreement as to the maximum supervised term he could receive. Put another way, the government is arguing that any such' discrepancy could not have affected Powell’s decision to plead guilty because the sentence imposed was within the range of possibilities a defendant accepts when deciding whether to plead guilty. Guidelines certainly are a relevant consideration for defendants entering a plea of guilty, the district court at the time of the plea al-locution frequently has too little information available to provide defendant with an accurate sentencing range. Accordingly, the court will not be in a position to know what the realistic sentencing range will be when the court explains the maximum range of sentences to the defendant at the Rule 11 hearing. Common sense suggests that a defendant’s realistic expectation of the sentence he or she will receive will often include considerations of applicable ranges under the Sentencing Guidelines. The government now argues that Mus-tafa creates a blanket rule that Rule 11 error is harmless so long as the defendant is not sentenced to a term longer than the maximum he or she is advised of. In contrast, Mustafa involved the defendant interpreting his own counsel’s best estimate as a “promise” as to the sentence he would receive. In reviewing the error, the court of appeals focused upon “whether the defendant’s knowledge and cómpre-hension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Id. The court in Raineri, therefore appropriately focused upon whether “the misinformation ... at the Rule 11 hearing lead [the defendant] to expect a lesser penalty than he actually received.” Id. In the words of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the defendant’s knowledge of the correct information “would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Johnson, 1 F.3d at 302. The court in Andrades, cited United States v. Raineri, in declaring: “we decline to adopt an inflexible rule” for resolving issues under Rule 11(h) Id. We must focus on the defendant’s ability to tender a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights given the misinformation he or she received. The court stated: We now join with those circuit courts of appeals holding that the error is harmless where the district court misinforms a defendant of the applicable supervised release term and the total sentence of imprisonment and supervised release actually imposed is less than that described during the plea allocution. For example, in United States v. Goins, 51 F.3d 400 (4th Cir.1995), the trial court’s failure to properly inform a defendant about a mandatory sentence was ruled not to be harmless under Rule 11(h). The government explained: The reason is that ... if the defendant is given the benefit of the doubt the plea agreement may conceivably be read as a promise by the government to recommend a term of supervised release of no more than three years. However, to the government’s credit, following oral argument, the United States Attorney’s Office sent a letter stating that it would recommend a three-year term of supervised release on remand if the district court asks for a recommendation from the government. In reviewing the error, the court of appeals focused upon “whether the defendant’s knowledge and cómpre-hension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Id. Whether the Government Breached the Guilty Plea Agreement Powell contends that he is entitled to specific performance because the government breached the guilty plea agreement that told him that he was only exposed to a maximum term of three years of supervised release. We must focus on the defendant’s ability to tender a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights given the misinformation he or she received. Powell agreed that the court could impose a sentence of life imprisonment, and that the court had to impose at least the 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and a three year term of supervised release. As noted above, it is undisputed that the government did inform him that the plea would only expose him to three years supervised release, and the court confirmed that at the change of plea hearing. § 924(e). See Apprendi, 120 S.Ct. at 490. . Kathleen Rice, counsel for the government. Accordingly, Apprendi does not apply. The government explained: The reason is that ... if the defendant is given the benefit of the doubt the plea agreement may conceivably be read as a promise by the government to recommend a term of supervised release of no more than three years. at 490 (emphasis in original). The district court confirmed those ranges during the Rule 11 colloquy. at 490 (emphasis in original). Mustafa also argued that the district court committed reversible error in not informing him that restitution could be ordered as part of the sentence in violation of Rule 11(c)(1). 42 F.3d at 42. conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”) (emphasis added).

The court found that the government's failure to correct the mistake when given the opportunity during oral argument was not sufficient to make the error harmless. Therefore, the court reversed Powell's sentence and remanded for further proceedings.",1,holding that a district court does not commit reversible error in failing to inform a defendant of the applicable sentence and the total sentence of imprisonment and supervised release actually imposed is less than that described during the plea colloquy,4,holding that a defendants knowledge of the reasonableness of the statutory maximum is not a proper basis for a sentence of supervised release,2
"But, conceding that he had the right to have the juror set aside after he made the discovery, no injury appears to have resulted, as no opinion as to the case, or animus or prejudice, is shown to have existed on the part of the juror against appellant.’ ” In West v. State, 54 Tex.Cr.R. A fortiori, the verdict is not vitiated thereby — at least unless the complainant can affirmatively show that the unaccepted juror was prejudiced.’ “In Anderson the Court cited Munson v. State, 34 Tex.Cr.R. 387, where the defendant urged that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse a juror ‘that he challenged ... on the list handed him.’ Such request was not made until after said juror was seated in the jury box, the jury was sworn, the indictment was read, and the defendant had entered his plea. In her sole ground of error, appellant contends that the court erred in denying her peremptory challenge to “juror number five.” The record reflects that after the names of twelve members of the panel were called by the clerk those persons were directed by the court to take a seat in the jury box. In Acosta v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 522 S.W.2d 528, where a juror who had been stricken by defendant on a peremptory challenge served on the jury, this Court said: “There can be no argument about appellant’s correctness in urging that a peremptory challenge can be made without a showing of prejudice. 387, were discussed by this Court in Acosta, where it was stated: “In Anderson v. State, 142 Tex.Cr.R. In Munson, it was stated: ‘He [defendant] should have discovered the mistake before the jury was sworn, and then made his motion to withdraw his plea, and discharge the jury, and draw another jury. that he had the right to have the juror set aside after he made the discovery, no injury appears to have resulted, as no opinion as to the case, or animus or prejudice, is shown to have existed on the part of the juror against appellant.’ ” In West v. State, 54 Tex.Cr.R. That’s correct.” Clerk of the court, Vernon Sanders, testified at the hearing on the motion for new trial in response to appellant’s questions: “Q. Mr. Karam [prosecutor], isn’t it a fact that before the testimony started in this case and during the recess, this was made known to the Court, to the clerk, that he had made a mistake? Oh yes, sir.” Unlike any of the cases cited herein, appellant brought the mistake to the attention of the trial court before the jury was sworn. 671, also cited by the State, a juror accepted by both the defendant and the State was left off the jury that heard the case. We do not find a lack of diligence on the part of appellant solely because of his failure to detect the error when the names of the jurors were called by the clerk when the appellant made the mistake known to the court before the jury was sworn. The record contains what appears to be a photocopy of “Defendant’s Jury List.” While the line drawn through prospective juror number 5, William Evans Huggins, is not a bold one, it is discernible.

"It ruled that Sandoval-Sanchez’ admission of his illegal presence in this country was the fruit of an unlawful arrest, and that the exclusionary rule applied in a deportation proceeding. In response to the agent’s questioning, Lopez-Mendoza gave his name and indicated that he was from Mexico with no close family ties in the United States. Lopez-Mendoza’s deportation order was vacated and his case remanded to the BIA to determine whether the Fourth Amendment had been violated in the course of his arrest. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed Sandoval-Sanchez’ deportation order and vacated and remanded Lopez-Mendoza’s deportation order. Lopez-Mendoza’s counsel moved to terminate the proceeding on the ground that Lopez-Mendoza had been arrested illegally. The judge ruled that the legality of the arrest was not relevant to the deportation proceeding and therefore declined to rule on the legality of Lopez-Mendoza’s arrest. On the basis of this evidence the Immigration Judge found Lopez-Mendoza deportable. Based on the written record of Sandoval-Sanchez’ admissions the Immigration Judge found him deportable and granted him voluntary departure. Sandoval-Sanchez exercised his right to a deportation hearing. At his deportation hearing Sandoval-Sanchez contended that the evidence offered by the INS should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest. On appeal the Court of Appeals concluded that Sandoval-Sanchez’ detention by the immigration officers violated the Fourth Amendment, that the statements he made were a product of that detention, and that the exclusionary rule barred their use in a deportation hearing. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 157 (1923) (involuntary confessions admissible at deportation hearing). The Immigration Judge considered and rejected Sandoval-Sanchez’ claim that he had been illegally arrested, but ruled in the alternative that the legality of the arrest was not relevant to the deportation hearing. The deportation order against Sandoval-Sanchez was accordingly reversed. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 157 (1923) (involuntary confessions admissible at deportation hearing). At stake in Janis was application of the exclusionary rule in a federal civil tax assessment proceeding following, the unlawful seizure of evidence by state, not federal, officials. In United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433 (1976), this Court set forth a framework for deciding in what types of proceeding application of the exclusionary rule is appropriate. The reach of the exclusionary rule beyond the context of a criminal prosecution, however, is less clear. The BIA correctly ruled that “[t]he mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deportation proceeding.” In re Lopez-Mendoza, No. Appeals have held, for example that the absence of Miranda warnings does not render an otherwise voluntary statement by the respondent inadmissible in a deportation case. Although this Court has once stated in dictum that “[i]t may be assumed that evidence obtained by the [Labor] Department through an illegal search and seizure cannot be made the basis of a finding in deportation proceedings,” United States ex rel. In these circumstances, the arresting officer is most unlikely to shape his conduct in anticipation of the exclusion of evidence at a formal deportation hearing. ... A person arrested on the preliminary warrant is not protected by a presumption of citizenship comparable to the presumption of innocence in a criminal case. Thus the arresting officer’s primary objective, in practice, will be to use evidence in the civil deportation proceeding. Every INS agent knows, therefore, that it is highly unlikely that any particular arrestee will end up challenging the lawfulness of his arrest in a formal deportation proceeding. The likely deterrence value of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings is difficult to assess. As recognized in Janis, the exclusionary rule is likely to be most effective when applied to such “intrasovereign” violations. The INS does not suggest that the exclusionary rule should not continue to apply in criminal proceedings against an alien who unlawfully enters or remains in this country, and the prospect of losing evidence that might otherwise be used in a criminal prosecution undoubtedly supplies some residual deterrent to unlawful conduct by INS officials. In these circumstances, the arresting officer is most unlikely to shape his conduct in anticipation of the exclusion of evidence at a formal deportation hearing. Important as it is to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of all persons, there is no convincing indication that application of the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings will contribute materially to that end. Finally, the deterrent value of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings is undermined by the availability of alternative remedies for institutional practices by the INS that might violate Fourth Amendment rights. But application of the exclusionary rule to civil deportation proceedings can be justified only if the rule is likely to add significant protection to these Fourth Amendment rights. His release would clearly frustrate the express public policy against an alien’s unregistered presence in this country. Applying the exclusionary rule in proceedings that are intended not to punish past transgressions but to prevent their continuance or renewal would require the courts to close their eyes to ongoing violations of the law. On the other side of the scale, the social costs of applying the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings are both unusual and significant. Our conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule’s value might change, if there developed good reason to believe that Fourth Amendment violations by INS officers were widespread. The BIA has described the practical problems as follows: “Absent the applicability of the exclusionary rule, questions relating to deportability routinely involve simple factual allegations and matters of proof. The costs of applying the exclusionary rule in the context of civil deportation hearings are high. Moreover, no challenge is raised here to the INS’s own internal regulations. Although the investigatory burden does not justify the commission of constitutional violations, the officers cannot be expected to compile elaborate, contemporaneous, written reports detailing the circumstances of every arrest. His release would clearly frustrate the express public policy against an alien’s unregistered presence in this country. Finally, the INS advances the credible argument that applying the exclusionary rule to deportation proceedings might well result in the suppression of large amounts of information that had been obtained entirely lawfully. In United States v. Wong Quong Wong, 94 F. 832 (Vt. 1899), a District Judge excluded letters seized from the appellant in a civil deportation proceeding. United States v. Leon, ante, at 928 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). Similarly, in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883 (1984), the Court concluded that an employer can be guilty of an unfair labor practice in his dealings with an alien notwithstanding the alien’s illegal presence in this country. In particular, application of the exclusionary rule in cases such as Sandoval-Sanchez’, would compel the courts to release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country. Moreover, no challenge is raised here to the INS’s own internal regulations. The Court of Appeals brushed over Lopez-Mendoza’s failure to object to the evidence in an apparently unsettled footnote of its decision. See also Matter of Garcia, 17 I.",holding that the balance between costs and benefits comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings," Holding: Exclusionary rule should not apply in civil deportation hearings due to the high costs of implementing the rule and the availability of alternative remedies for fourth amendment violations by INS officers; balancing social cost and benefits of applying the rule in deportation proceedings, it would not contribute materially to the protection of fourth amendment rights.",4,holding that the exclusionary rule does not apply in civil deportation hearings.,4,holding that the exclusionary rule is most effective in a deportation proceeding,1,holding that the exclusionary rule is not required to apply to civil deportation proceedings,4
"The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statutory notice requirement did not apply to vicariously liable tortfeasors such as James Johnson. In his action, Oslund alleged that because James Johnson, Grant’s father, gave Grant permission to drive the van, Johnson was liable for injuries arising from the accident. The following day, Johnson served a third-party complaint against the two bars, alleging that they had illegally served his son alcoholic beverages on February 12 and 13, 1994, and thus he, James Johnson, was entitled to contribution or indemnity from the bars. Fifty-eight days later, James Johnson served a notice of claim against the appellants, the CC Club and the Uptown Bar, the last two bars to serve Grant Johnson alcoholic beverages before the accident. The following day, Johnson served the two bars with a third-party complaint. The two bars brought motions” for summary judgment, arguing that Johnson had failed to meet the notice requirement of Minn.Stat. Eleven months later, Oslund commenced an action against Grant Johnson’s father, respondent James Johnson, for injuries arising from this accident. As Johnson is not a liquor vendor being sued for contribution or indemnity, the 60-day notice provision does not apply to him. § 340A.802 states that the notice requirement applies to persons claiming “contribution or indemnity * * * for or because of an injury within the scope of section 340A.801” (emphasis added). 2, a person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor must serve that vendor with notice of that claim within “120 days after the injury occurs.” Because Johnson is a person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor, he was required to comply with the 120-day provision. For example, subdivision 1 of Minn.Stat. As such, we apply de novo review to the district court’s decision.. Next, we analyze the 120-day provision as applied to Johnson. Alternatively, the court concluded that even if the 60-day notice provision applies, Johnson was in compliance because he served the notice of injury within 60 days of being served with the summons and complaint against him. For example, subdivision 1 of Minn.Stat. Under Minn.Stat.",holding that a tortfeasor seeking contribution and indemnification is required to follow the 120day notice provision in the cda and not the 60day notice provision," In the case, the Minnesota Court ofAppeals held that the statutory notice requirement applies to vicariously liable tortfeasors such as James Johnson and that he was required to comply with the 120-day provision for contribution or indemnity claims against liquor vendors.",3,"  Sure, here are the holdings from the case document you provided:

1. The balance between costs and benefits comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings.
2. The statutory notice requirement does not apply to vicariously liable tortfeasors such as James Johnson.
3. A person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor must serve notice of that claim within 120 days after the injury occurs.
4. The 60-day notice provision applies to persons claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor, but the court may apply de novo review to the district court's decision.
5. Even if the 60-day notice provision applies, a person is in compliance with the notice requirement if they serve the notice of injury within 60 days of being served with the summons and complaint against them.",1,holding that a person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor must serve that vendor with notice of that claim within 120 days after the injury occurs,5,holding that the notice requirement applies to a person whose claim is based on an injury within the scope of the statutory notice requirement,3
"The court limited the scope of K’s testimony, however, by precluding the state from eliciting testimony regarding “unduly prejudicial” and irrelevant details of the defendant’s abuse of K. At trial, K testified that, from 1986 to January, 1994, the defendant had sexually molested her. After arguments from counsel, the trial court concluded, pursuant to State v. Kulmac, supra, 230 Conn. 43, that K’s testimony was relevant and material to proving the defendant’s common plan or scheme to abuse young girls sexually, and that the probative value of K’s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. K stated that, in the initial stages of the abuse, which commenced when K was between six and seven years old, the defendant would touch her genitals and force her to touch his genitals. After K had reported the alleged abuse in 1994, the defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes § 53a-95 (a) in connection with his abuse of K. K declined to testify at the defendant’s trial on that charge, however. The defendant’s sexual abuse of T began in April, 1993, during an incident in which the defendant entered the bathroom just after T had taken a bath. At the time of the defendant’s January, 2001 trial, T was fifteen years old. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion in limine and allowed K to testify. The court limited the scope of K’s testimony, however, by precluding the state from eliciting testimony regarding “unduly prejudicial” and irrelevant details of the defendant’s abuse of K. At trial, K testified that, from 1986 to January, 1994, the defendant had sexually molested her. K stated that, in the initial stages of the abuse, which commenced when K was between six and seven years old, the defendant would touch her genitals and force her to touch his genitals. See State v. Merriam, supra, 621-24. We note that, in sexual abuse cases, we have construed liberally the standard for admitting prior misconduct evidence to demonstrate a common plan or scheme. On appeal, Merriam challenged the trial court’s decision to allow the state to elicit, under the common plan or scheme exception, testimony from Merriam’s biological daughter that Merriam previously had sexually abused her. Conn. 43, that K’s testimony was relevant and material to proving the defendant’s common plan or scheme to abuse young girls sexually, and that the probative value of K’s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. In assessing whether prior misconduct evidence offered under the common plan or scheme exception satisfies the first prong of this test, we have required a determination that “the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Finally, the defendant’s sexual abuse of K was “committed upon [a person] similar to the prosecuting witness.” Id. In addition, Kulmac’s sexual abuse of S occurred when Kulmac lived in close proximity to S, that is, in an apartment with S’s sister above S’s family residence. Moreover, the defendant’s sexual abuse of K was “similar to the offense charged . Id., 662-63. In the present case, the defendant’s acts of abuse against K and T were not too remote in time. Moreover, the early acts of Kulmac’s sexual abuse of S resembled those against K and C. Id., 59-60. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prior sexual abuse of K was sufficiently similar to that of T so as to satisfy the first prong of our two-pronged test for the admissibility of prior misconduct evidence under the common plan or scheme exception. With respect to the second prong of our test, the defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the prejudicial effect of the evidence of prior sexual abuse did not outweigh its probative value. When the trial court has “heard a lengthy offer of proof and arguments of counsel before performing the required balancing test,” has “specifically found that the evidence was highly probative and material, and that its probative value significantly outweighed the prejudicial effect,” and has “instructed the jury on the limited use of the evidence in order to safeguard against misuse and to minimize the prejudicial impact”; State v. Kulmac, supra, 230 Conn. 63; we have found no abuse of discretion under the second prong. We are unpersuaded by this argument in light of the fact that the defendant’s sexual abuse of T and K ceased upon K’s reporting of the defendant’s abuse in January, 1994. With respect to the defendant’s claim that the trial court did not adequately identify “the actual degree to which [K’s testimony] would be likely to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury,” we recognize that “[t]here are situations [in which] the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In the present case, the record reflects that the trial court considered the probative value of K’s testimony and its prejudicial effect. .” The defendant also maintains that the admission of K’s testimony effectively transformed the case into “a trial within a trial” and forced the defendant “to defend against both sets of charges and the substantially more serious allegations [of K] . State v. Sandoval, supra, 263 Conn. 544, quoting State v. Copas, 252 Conn. 318, 329-30, 746 A.2d 761 (2000); see also State v. Robertson, 254 Conn. 739, 758, 760 A.2d 82 (2000) (“Although the tapes were prejudicial, all incriminating evidence is prejudicial. See, e.g., State v. Baldwin, supra, 224 Conn. 358 (“by the time the misconduct evidence was offered, the jury had already heard evidence about the two sales [of narcotics] . Moreover, we note that evidence, such as K’s testimony of sexual abuse, is less likely to “unduly arouse the jur[ors’] emotions, hostility or sympathy”; (internal quotation marks omitted) State v. Ferguson, supra, 260 Conn. 359; when similar evidence, such as T’s testimony of sexual abuse, already has been presented to the jury. would have improperly arouse [d] the emotions of the jur[ors] ... in light of the victim’s previous testimony” [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); State v. Dehaney, 261 Conn. 336, 358, 803 A.2d 267 (2002) (“[i]n light of the other evidence of the defendant’s violent and emotional nature, the victim’s statement, ‘I fear for the safety of the lives of me [and] my children,’ cannot reasonably be characterized as unfairly prejudicial”), cert. that “[s]uch limiting instructions serve to minimize any prejudicial effect that such evidence otherwise may have had”; State v. O’Neil, 261 Conn. 49, 82, 801 A.2d 730 (2002); see also State v. Sandoval, 263 Conn. 524, 545-46, 821 A.2d 247 (2003) (“any possible prejudice could have been minimized or even eliminated by an instruction cautioning the jury about the limited purpose of the evidence”); and, “[i]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the jury properly followed those instructions.” State v. O’Neil, supra, 82. We note that “[a]ll adverse evidence is [by definition] damaging to one’s case, but [such evidence] is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted.” (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) With respect to the defendant’s contention that he had to defend against the “more serious allegations” of his sexual abuse of K, we recognize that the testimony of K, like that of T, undoubtedly had an impact on the jury; such is the nature of testimony disclosing facts of child sexual abuse. . . . . . . . See U.S. I, § 10, cl. XIV, § 1. Const., art. shall be guilty of a class C felony.” (Emphasis added.) The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant’s claims. 2d 63 (1997); the defendant’s claims satisfy the first two prongs of Golding and, therefore, are reviewable. .” U.S. Id., 301. . . . . . age of sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is violative of that [version of § 53-21 that was in effect at the time of the defendant’s abuse of T].” State v. Pickering, supra, 64; accord State v. Zwirn, 210 Conn. 582, 588, 556 A.2d 588 (1989); State v. Schriver, 207 Conn. 456, 463, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). Id., 300-301. The case law, read in conjunction with the text of the pre-1995 amendment version of § 53-21, “serve[d] to warn a potential violator that the deliberate touching of the private or intimate parts of a child under sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is prohibited.” State v. Perruccio, 192 Conn. 154, 161, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997); accord State v. Miranda, supra, 103. 95-142, § 1, although applied retroactively to the defendant’s case, effected changes in the law so as to “disadvantage the offender affected by it ... by altering the definition of criminal conduct . See id., 284, 297. 2d 185 (1975); accord State v. Miranda, 260 Conn. 93, 102-103, 794 A.2d 506, cert. See id., 160. See id., 156,158. Applying the definition of “intimate parts” contained in § 53a-65 (8) to Perruccio’s actions, we determined that Permccio had committed an act that was likely to impair the morals of a child, in violation of the statute. Accordingly, the defendant’s due process claim fails. The acts alleged here are of sexual contact. B The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on “borrowed” definitions of “intimate parts” and “sexual contact” contained in § 53a-65 but not contained in the version of § 53-21 in effect at the time of the defendant’s sexual abuse of T in 1993 and 1994. Again, however, the actor need . See id., 160. See id. See id. See id. We disagree. Id. Id. After considering arguments from counsel, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion for a mistrial. State v. Singh, 259 Conn. 693, 699, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). The trial court reasoned that the state’s attorney’s question was “a fleeting reference on a one time occurrence,” and concluded that it was “not sufficient to declare a mistrial because a curative instruction will solve the problem.” After the jury returned to the courtroom, but before the state’s attorney was allowed to continue his cross-examination of the defendant, the trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: “[I]n the last question asked just before you went out, there was a reference by [the state’s attorney] in his question to the defendant concerning his conversation with [T and K’s grandmother]. The burden of proving a constitutional violation as a result of prosecutorial misconduct rests with the defendant; see, e.g., State v. Brown, 256 Conn. 291, 298, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. See, e.g., State v. Copas, 252 Conn. 318, 340, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). 2d 584 (2001); and the defendant “must demonstrate substantial prejudice.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) With respect to curative instructions that are given in response to an alleged impropriety, we repeatedly have held that “the jury is presumed to follow the court’s curative instructions in the absence of some indication to the contrary”; State v. Grenier, 257 Conn. 797, 810, 778 A.2d 159 (2001); State v. McIntyre, 250 Conn. 526, 533, 737 A.2d 392 (1999) (“[i]t is to be presumed that the jury followed the court’s [curative] instructions unless the contrary appears” [internal quotation marks omitted]); State v. Wooten, 227 Conn. 677, 694, 631 A.2d 271 (1993) (“[j]urors are presumed to follow the instructions given by the judge” [internal quotation marks omitted]); and we have recognized that “a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Id., 401. “Q. “Q.",recognizing trauma that new trial would likely bring to victim of child sexual assault,Holding: The defendant's due process claim fails.,1,"  Holding: The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the holding to the language of the case. The holding is:

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of K’s testimony by precluding the state from eliciting testimony regarding the details of the abuse that were too remote in time, irrelevant, or unduly prejudicial. The trial court limited the scope of K’s testimony to events that occurred between 1986 and January 1994, the time period during which the defendant had sexually molested her. The court also instructed the jury to consider only the probative value of K’s testimony in assessing the defendant’s guilt or innocence. The defendant's argument that the trial court's limiting instruction was too broad and allowed the jury to convict him based on improper evidence is rejected. The trial court's limiting instruction was reasonable and did not result in undue prejudice to the defendant.

Additionally, the defendant's claim that the admission of K's testimony effectively transformed the case into a ""trial within a trial"" and forced him to defend against both sets of charges and the substantially more serious allegations of K is without merit. The trial court's admission of K's testimony was not unfairly prejudicial, and the defendant's arguments to the contrary are rejected.

In conclusion, the holding is that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of K's testimony, and the defendant's conviction is affirmed.",1,holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony regarding the victims prior sexual abuse of k,5,holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants motion for a mistrial where the defendants testimony was sufficient to support the defendants claim that the defendants sexual abuse of her was a crime that was not so vague as to be a result of the defendants conduct,2
"Commerce rejected FMC’s request for a COP investigation, finding that there was no reasonable basis to believe Negev was making home market sales at prices below the COP. FMC argued that the financial statement, together with the consultant’s 1986 report, provided a reasonable basis for Commerce to conduct a COP investigation. On January 27, 1992, FMC renewed its request for a COP investigation of Negev’s IPA home market sales. The third administrative review of the an-tidumping order was initiated on September 24, 1990, covering Negev’s IPA exports during the period August 1, 1989, through July 31, 1990 (1989-90 review period). Accordingly, in light of Commerce’s finding that Negev was not dumping for three consecutive years, the an-tidumping duty order was revoked against Negev. In support of its request, FMC submitted a consultant’s report prepared by an outside expert, containing a worldwide study of the IPA industry. FMC submitted no challenge to the results of the first two reviews. Nor do we find any clear error or misjudgment of the evidence in the CIT’s conclusion that FMC is not likely to succeed in proving the second count of its complaint. Although we find that the CIT’s finding on irreparable harm is clearly erroneous, we nonetheless find that the CIT did not abuse its discretion in making the ultimate determination that a preliminary injunction is not warranted. The relevant statutory language, with respect to the first count in FMC’s complaint, is 19 U.S.C. Likelihood of Success In the course of denying FMC’s motion for a preliminary injunction, the CIT held that FMC failed to establish that it was likely to succeed in proving the merits of its case. In this case, the CIT held that FMC failed to establish that it would be irreparably harmed absent the grant of a preliminary injunction or that it was likely to succeed in proving the merits of its case. Commerce rejected the consultant’s report as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it was based on outdated information which was at least three-years old, and because no effort had been made to update the study with current information made available through Negev’s 1991 questionnaire response. Thus, Commerce is required to conduct a COP investigation if it has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that home market sales were made at prices below the COP; and it is Commerce who must determine whether sales were made at less than the COP of the merchandise. Commerce also rejected Negev’s 1990 financial statement as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it did not constitute an accurate picture of Negev’s IPA home market sales. Accordingly, the CIT’s finding that FMC failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its case is not clearly erroneous. Commerce rejected the consultant’s report as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it was based on outdated information which was at least three-years old, and because no effort had been made to update the study with current information made available through Negev’s 1991 questionnaire response. Finally, with respect to the third count in FMC’s complaint, FMC argues that Commerce’s refusal to grant additional time to submit supplemental information on the COP issue violated its procedural due process rights. Thus, FMC’s argument that it was prejudiced because it was entitled to 60 days, instead of the 31 days granted, for preparation of its response is not supported by the record or the regulations. Commerce also rejected the consultant’s report because it failed to index the COP for inflation. For example, FMC failed to evaluate the effect of the change in Negev’s production capacity from 1986 to 1989 and to make adjustments for any increases or decreases in costs resulting from the economies of scale. To this extent, we disagree with the CIT’s determination and find that FMC has made a showing of some irreparable harm. Accordingly, the CIT’s finding that FMC failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its case is not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the court recognized that the harm caused by liquidating the entries at issue would not be simply economic but would extend to Zenith’s statutory right to obtain meaningful judicial review of the determination. First, it argues that the CIT made an erroneous finding in view of this court’s holding in Zenith that the liquidation of section 751 entries pending appeal constitutes irreparable injury. Absent the issuance of a preliminary injunction, FMC will be deprived of meaningful judicial review of the administrative determination that there was no dumping for the 1989-90 review period. Although FMC’s minimal effort may have been sufficient to establish that irreparable harm exists, FMC’s failure to submit any other evidence to establish the extent of that harm now proves fatal to its appeal. Although the CIT erred when it failed to recognize that there would be some irreparable harm, FMC fails to convince us that the CIT abused its discretion in reaching the ultimate determination that a preliminary injunction is not warranted. To this extent, we disagree with the CIT’s determination and find that FMC has made a showing of some irreparable harm. A temporary injunction issued August 27, 1992 by a motions panel of this court prevented the liquidation of Negev’s entries pending this appeal. However, FMC’s burden does not end here. The court suggests that it supports a finding of irreparable harm through the petitioner’s loss of a competitive position caused by the continuous dumping. CONCLUSION In view of the foregoing, we hold that the CIT did not abuse its discretion when it denied the preliminary injunction. Absent such a showing, we cannot find that the CIT abused its discretion in this case. Accordingly, the CIT’s judgment is AFFIRMED. The court suggests that it supports a finding of irreparable harm through the petitioner’s loss of a competitive position caused by the continuous dumping.",holding that no one factor is determinative and the weakness of  one factor may be overborne by the strength of the others," Holding: In this case, the CIT did not abuse its discretion when it denied the preliminary injunction, as FMC had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its case and could not demonstrate irreparable harm.",3,Holding: The balance between costs and benefits comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings.,1,holding that the cit did not abuse its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction where the plaintiff failed to establish that it would be likely to succeed in proving the merits of its case,4,holding that the ct did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a summary injunction because it did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a summary injunction,2
"McDonald returned to the property on December 28, 1992. Lennick, 18 F.3d at 820. Count I: Establishment of Manufacturing Operations As to Count I, the government had to prove that Basinger (1) knowingly (2) opened or maintained a place (3) for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using methamphetamine. Basinger sought and received permission to live on the property during the winter. WIGGINS, Circuit Judge: OVERVIEW In January 1994, a jury convicted Steaven M. Basinger of establishing a drug manufacturing facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support Basinger’s conviction on this count. He was convicted on both counts on January 21, 1994. See United States v. Calabrese, 825 F.2d 1342, 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1987) (finding sufficient evidence to support conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine based largely on equipment containing trace amounts of methamphetamine seized on the defendant’s premises). EXPERT TESTIMONY Over Basinger’s objection, the district court allowed a government expert witness, Roger Ely, to estimate how much methamphetamine could be produced at the site using the red phosphorus method of production. Basinger argues that the government’s failure to inform him before trial that Ely would testify along those lines violated Fed.R.Crim.P. Evidence was introduced that Basinger on a previous occasion had been found in possession of methamphetamine and red phosphorous, which is an essential chemical in the production of methamphetamine by the “red phosphorous method” (probably used in this lab, according to expert testimony). 276, 126 L.Ed.2d 227 (1993); United States v. Disla, 805 F.2d 1340, 1350 (9th Cir.1986) (constructive possession of contraband may be shown by defendant’s “ ‘exclusive control or dominion over property on which contraband [is] found’ ”) (citation omitted). We hold that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Basinger manufactured the methamphetamine found in the shed. Count II: Manufacture of Methamphetamine As to Count II, the government had to prove that Basinger (1) knowingly or intentionally (2) manufactured methamphetamine. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 603. United States v. Becker, 23 F.3d 1537, 1539 (9th Cir.1994). See Baker, 10 F.3d at 1398. See United States v. Lopez-Martinez, 725 F.2d 471, 476 (9th Cir. United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1993). 139, 88 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). EXPERT TESTIMONY Over Basinger’s objection, the district court allowed a government expert witness, Roger Ely, to estimate how much methamphetamine could be produced at the site using the red phosphorus method of production. First, he argues that the district court based its sentence on an erroneous calculation of the amount of methamphetamine Basinger manufactured. The evidence is “prejudicial only to the extent that it tends to prove the fact justifying its admission, namely that [Basinger] had knowledge.” Ramirez-Jiminez, 967 F.2d at 1327. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 604. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 603. The court, at Basinger’s request, accepted the second method of calculation. Quantity of Methamphetamine Produced The district court calculated Basinger’s sentence based on its determination that 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine were produced at the site. United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1993). Crowell, 9 F.3d at 1455. Accordingly, we hold that the court did not commit clear error by sentencing Basinger based on its finding that 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine were produced at the lab. § 2D1.1 Basinger argues that because the sentencing court could not calculate the amount of methamphetamine the lab could produce with any certainty, the court should have applied U.S.S.G. United States v. Acevedo, 28 F.3d 686, 689-90 (7th Cir.1994) (allowing sentencing court to calculate the amount of cocaine distributed based on capacity of empty baggies with cocaine residue in them). See Williams, 989 F.2d at 1073. See Williams, 989 F.2d at 1073. Basinger argues that despite this evidence, the rule of lenity requires sentencing based on L-Methamphetamine. See Bertrand, 926 F.2d at 846-47 (district court's finding concerning production capability of lab was not clearly erroneous where ""the district court apparently concluded that, although no hydriodic acid [a precursor chemical] was present, it easily could be obtained""). In this case, however, the methamphetamine was seized in conjunction with a 90-pound drum of red phosphorous and a large sum of cash. See United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, 57 F.3d 1506, 1513-14, 1515 (9th Cir.1995) (evidence of a defendant’s prior possession of personal-use amount of methamphetamine should have been excluded under Rule 404(b) because it did not tend to prove that the defendant possessed hydriodic acid with the knowledge that it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine). Because this is not a case in which ""it is simply not possible for the [district] court to make a reliable estimate of the amount of drugs involved,” Basinger's reliance on United States v. Perrone, 936 F.2d 1403, 1419 (1991) (holding that sentence should be based on amount of precursor chemicals possessed by the defendant, rather than on the amount of cocaine that could have been manufactured with the precursors), clarified, 949 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.1993), is misplaced.",holding that where the district court was able to estimate drug quantity there is no reason to depart from 2d11," Holding that based on the sufficient evidence, Basinger's conviction on Count I for establishing a drug manufacturing facility and Count II for manufacturing methamphetamine was supported, and the sentencing court's determination of 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine being produced at the lab, applying the Rule of Lenity, was not clear error.",5,"  Here are the holdings from the case document:

1. The balance between the costs and benefits of applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings comes out against applying the rule.
2. The government had to prove that Basinger (1) knowingly (2) opened or maintained a place (3) for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using methamphetamine.
3. The evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Basinger manufactured the methamphetamine found in the shed.
4. The district court did not commit clear error by sentencing Basinger based on its finding that 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine were produced at the site.",1,holding that the district court did not err in failing to give the defendant a fair opportunity to object to the defendants prior possession of methamphetamine because the defendant had not been charged with possession of methamphetamine,2,holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a defendants motion to amend his sentence based on the defendants prior possession of personal use amount of a firearm,2
"On August 18, 2014, the Trustee filed his Objection by Chapter 7 Trustee to Debt- or’s Claim of Exemption in Real Property and Request for Relief from a Final Order on Abandonment of the Real Property (“Objection”), arguing that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption in the Subject Property. The Debtor filed a motion to compel abandonment of three single family residences, including the Subject Property (“Motion to Compel Abandonment”). Regarding the Subject Property, the Debtor stated that she claimed a $175,000 homestead exemption due to a disability. The Trustee argues that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption, so the deadline for his objection was extended under Rule 4003(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. However, if the Debtor had fraudulently asserted the claim of homestead exemption, the Trustee’s objection on August 18, 2014 would be timely under Rule 4003(b)(2). The court noted in its final ruling that, in the absence of fraud, the Trustee had until February 20, 2014 to object to the Debtor’s claim of exemption. The court granted the Motion to Compel Abandonment of the two properties, including the Subject Property. In its final ruling, the court again overruled the objection, holding that the Debt- or did not “fraudulently assert[ ] the claim of exemption.” The court stated: Based on the declaration of Joanna Mendoza submitted by the trustee, it appears to be an accurate statement that the debtor did not actually reside in the Property on October 25, 2013. The court continued: Here, the trustee’s evidence goes only to the question of whether the debtor properly prepared her tax returns; the court finds that evidence to be insufficient to rebut the presumption that the debtor resided in the Property on the petition date. At the outset, the Trustee agreed with the court that Rule 4003(b)(2) is to be read as requiring the Trustee to show that the Debtor fraudulently “asserted the exemption at the time the exemption was claimed.” However, the Trustee argued that the Debtor, “from the very first filing, set to out deceive the court, the trustee and her creditors by stating she lived at” the Subject Property. The court said that the Trustee should have “taken more concrete steps to determine whether the debtor was actually living on the Property [after the meeting of creditors].” The court found that “the debtor’s use of a post office box address ... might reasonably have been expected to put the trustee on notice he should investigate the question of her actual residence further.” The court said It is whether the debtor resided in the Property on the date her petition was filed, October 25, 2013.... [Presumably, she was living in one of the three properties she owns; the trustee has .given the court no reason to believe it was not the one in which she has claimed thé homestead exemption. The court noted in its final ruling that, in the absence of fraud, the Trustee had until February 20, 2014 to object to the Debtor’s claim of exemption. She claimed that her former attorney, Mr. Ensminger, had advised her that as long as she kept most of her personal belongings at [the Subject Property], and did not reside primarily at any other home, then the court would consider [the Subject Property] as her primary residence. In its final ruling, the court again overruled the objection, holding that the Debt- or did not “fraudulently assert[ ] the claim of exemption.” The court stated: Based on the declaration of Joanna Mendoza submitted by the trustee, it appears to be an accurate statement that the debtor did not actually reside in the Property on October 25, 2013. The court issued its order overruling the Renewed Objection on December 18, 2014. It matters only whether she fraudulently asserted the exemption, such that the late objection should be allowed under Rule 4003(b)(2).” In sum, the court concluded that the debtor’s testimony in response to the trustee’s earlier objection to exemption that she “[has] been residing at [the Subject Property] ... continuously for all of 2012, 2013 and all of 2014 through the date of this declaration” is quite troubling to this court. ISSUE Whether the bankruptcy court erred in overruling the Trustee’s objection to the Debtor’s claim of a homestead exemption in the Subject Property. It is undisputed that the bankruptcy court did not have the benefit of Mr. Ensminger’s declaration when it ruled on the Objection and Renewed Objection. The court did not believe the Trustee’s assertion that hé only realized that the Debtor did not reside at the Subject Property when he received her 2013 tax returns. However, that fact alone — which is virtually the only fact the trustee relies on — is not sufficient to establish that the debtor' “fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption,” as required for a finding that the trustee’s objection is timely under Rule 4003(b)(2). In re Kelley, 300 B.R. In re Kelley, 300 B.R. In re Kelley, 300 B.R. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004)). Decker v. Tramiel (In re JTS Corp.), 617 F.3d 1102, 1109 (9th Cir.2010). 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). BAP 2007) (quoting Lamie v. U.S. 455, 473 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2001) (“When Congress uses a familiar legal expression and does not provide a definition, that connotes Congress’ intent that the words be given their usual legal meaning.” (citation omitted)). The question under Rule 4003(b)(2) is whether the debtor “fraudulently asserted” the exemption. 535, 541 (D.Nev.2008) (“Statements made in bankruptcy schedules are executed under penalty of perjury and, when offered against the debtor, ‘are eligible for treatment as [evidentiary] admissions.’ ” (quoting In re Bohrer, 266 B.R. 812, 822 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2015) (“a plaintiff does not have a duty to investigate”). We conclude that the bankruptcy court misinterpreted Rule 4003(b)(2). v. Eashai (In re Eashai), 87 F.3d 1082, 1090-91 (9th Cir.1996)); see also La Trattoria, Inc. v. Lansford (In re Lansford), 822 F.2d 902, 904 (9th Cir.1987) (“Having intentionally misled the sellers in an area he knew was important to them, it is unseemly for Lansford now to argue that he should be excused from section 523 because the sellers believed him.”); Salehsari v. Aalam (In re Aalam), 538 B.R. Thus, we hold that, to determine whether a debtor “fraudulently asserted” an exemption claim within the meaning of Rule 4003(b)(2), the bankruptcy court should apply the usual definition of fraud, except the damages requirement, which has no bearing on the question of exemptions. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, stating that, because the debtors’ schedules were vague and did not inform the trustee that the debtors were claiming an exemption on the full value of the property, “the trustee had no basis for objecting, and could well have suffered the bankruptcy judge’s ire had he objected to the $45,000 exemption to which the Hymans were clearly entitled.” In re Hyman, 967 F.2d at 1319. Therefore, we hold that the bankruptcy court erred when it ruled that the Trustee failed to timely investigate the Debtor’s claim of exemption. In James, the court found, as a matter of fact, that “no actual fraud was committed by” the debtor. The Panel noted the strict standard set forth in Taylor. Nothing in Rule 4003(b)(2) suggests that the drafters intended to impose a duty on objectors to investigate promptly. In Hyman v. Plotkin (In re Hyman), 967 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir.1992), the debtors claimed a homestead exemption, but contended that their description of the exemption as merely “homestead,” rather than “homestead exemption,” indicated that they were claiming as exempt the entire homestead, rather than the limited dollar amount allowed by California law. In this case, the Debtor asserted a claim of exemption based on false predicates and later continued to mislead the Trustee and the court with further false statements. Therefore, we remand this case to permit the bankruptcy court to apply the correct legal definition of the phrase “fraudulently asserted” and to consider whether the evidence shows that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court determined that, while the Debtor’s statements regarding her residence may have been “inaccurate, and possibly deliberately so,” it could not conclude that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court erred by discounting the Debtor’s subsequent actions and statements as evidence of a fraudulent assertion of a claim of exemption. However, it stated “that neither this Panel nor the Ninth Circuit has interpreted Taylor as holding that failure by the trustee to object to a claim of exemption will always result in the debtor being entitled to a.full exemption in the subject property. The bankruptcy court’s decision implies that a debtor’s false testimony after the debtor files the schedules cannot establish that the debtor’s exemption- claims were fraudulent when made. The Panel held that any ambiguity in the schedules should be construed against the debtor and that the debtor’s schedules were not sufficient to put the trustee on notice of the 'lawsuit. First, they rejected the notion that, under Taylor, “failure by the trustee to object to a claim of exemption will always result in the debtor being entitled to a full exemption in the subject property.” Id. Therefore, we remand this case to permit the bankruptcy court to apply the correct legal definition of the phrase “fraudulently asserted” and to consider whether the evidence shows that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. We do not think that this case presents such exceptional circumstances as to warrant the Panel’s consideration of this new evidence in “the interests of justice.” The Trustee could have sought a continuance of the hearing on the Renewed Objection while he attempted to obtain Mr. Ensminger’s declaration; he could also have moved under Civil Rule 60(b)(2) or (3) to have the bankruptcy court consider the new evidence. The Debtor claimed the homestead exemption in her Schedule C under section 704.950 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. In an appropriate case, this extrinsic evidence may include the debtor’s subsequent statements and conduct. The amount of exemption is codified in section 704.730(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which states, in relevant part: The amount of the homestead exemption is one of the following: (1) Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,-000) unless the judgment debtor or spouse of the judgment debtor who resides in the homestead is a person described in paragraph (2) or (3). The bankruptcy court’s decision implies that a debtor’s false testimony after the debtor files the schedules cannot establish that the debtor’s exemption- claims were fraudulent when made. D. The Panel will not consider new evidence not in the record before the bankruptcy court. The proper basis for the Debtor's claim of a homestead exemption would have been section 704.720, which provides that “[a] homestead is exempt from sale under this division to the extent provided in Section 704.800.” Cal.Civ.Proc.Code § 704.720. The Debtor claimed the homestead exemption in her Schedule C under section 704.950 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. (2) The homestead exemption set forth in Section 704.730. At least one California bankruptcy court has held that, if the debtor chooses a state law exemption, then state law allocates the burden of proof notwithstanding Rule 4003(c). However, similar to the deadline set in § 727(e) of the Code for revoking a discharge which was fraudulently obtained, an objection to an exemption that was fraudulently claimed must be filed within one year after the closing of the case.",holding that the objector must not only show that the facts do not support the exemption but must also prove that the debtor knowingly deceived the trustee and the creditors at the time the exemption was made," In sum, the court concluded that the question under Rule 4003(b)(2) is whether the debtor “fraudulently asserted” the claim of exemption; the bankruptcy court misinterpreted this requirement, focusing on the timing of the objection rather than the merits, resulting in a correctable error.",2,"  Holding: The bankruptcy court erred in overruling the Trustee's objection to the Debtor's claim of homestead exemption. The court should have applied the usual definition of fraud, except the damages requirement, to determine whether the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court's decision implies that a debtor's false testimony after the debtor files the schedules cannot establish that the debtor's exemption claims were fraudulent when made.
