"French Lilly further testified that some time thereafter the policy written by Mrs. Foster was mailed to him, inasmuch as plaintiff also resided in Wyoming County, and that he thereupon mailed the policy to the plaintiff, not at that time being aware of the fact that the policy was written for the same man who had been refused insurance previously by the witness. As a result of the telephone conversation, the plaintiff called upon Mrs. Foster, who issued the insurance policy in question. Later, however, the home office learned of the false answer contained in the application; and on March 8, 1957, wrote a letter to the plaintiff detailing the facts in relation to the false answer contained in the application, and notifying the plaintiff that his insurance policy was rescinded. At the time the letter of December 20 was written, the home office did not know of the accident involving the cow, or of the occurrence which resulted in the destruction of the automobile, and did not know of the fact that the application made by plaintiff contained a false statement of facts. French Lilly of Oceana, in Wyoming County, an agent for the defendant company, testified that “in the neighborhood of July in 1956”, the plaintiff showed to the witness a letter disclosing that the plaintiff’s automobile insurance with another company was being cancelled and that thereupon the witness refused to write a policy of insurance on behalf of the defendant company covering plaintiff’s automobile. As a consequence thereof, the home office wrote a letter to the plaintiff, dated December 20, 1956, three days after the automobile was demolished, notifying the plaintiff that his insurance policy would be cancelled as of January 2, 1957, and advising him to obtain proper insurance in the meantime with another company. The defendant offered the letter of March 8 for introduction in evidence, the plaintiff objected, and the court refused to permit the introduction of such letter as a part of the evidence to be considered by the jury. The defendant offered the letter of March 8 for introduction in evidence, the plaintiff objected, and the court refused to permit the introduction of such letter as a part of the evidence to be considered by the jury. Thereupon, the court made the following statement to the jury: “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there are two questions to be decided in this case. After the completion of the testimony at the trial before a jury, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict in its favor, which motion was overruled. In his written opinion, which was made a part of the record, the eminent trial judge stated: “I am of the opinion that the knowledge of the agent of the company at Oceana is imputed to its principal, the defendant company, and the defendant company having had knowledge of a prior cancellation through its agent and in its principal offices, had an election to either treat the policy as void or rescind it as of a future date. The company elected to rescind and prior to the date of rescinding, the loss occurred.” Prior to the time of the trial, the defendant filed its specification of defense in accordance with the provisions of Code, 56-4-21, a portion of which was as follows: “That the plaintiff fraudulently procured the said policy of insurance by the wilful, intentional, making of false and fraudulent answers and misrepresentations upon his application for said policy of insurance, with full knowledge at the time of making said false statements and answers that the defendant would not have issued said policy of insurance had the defendant known that the statements and answers as given were false. The trial court deducted this sum from $2,800.00, the value placed on the automobile by the jury’s verdict, and entered judgment for the plaintiff for the balance, amounting to $271.45. The defendant, however, in order to save the point, took testimony in relation to the letter outside the presence and hearing of the jury, and the letter was made a part of the record. 2 syl., 140 S.

"Lastly, the joinder of William as a respondent will also serve the child’s interest in having her paternity decided swiftly and finally, for a decision rendered in a proceeding in which he is not a party cannot bind him, and leaves open the possibility of a later order declaring him to be the father (see, Matter of Tyrone G. v Fifi N., supra, at 14; cf., Matter of Cathleen P. v Gary P., 63 NY2d 805, 808, supra). [Sandra C.] v Thomas J.S., 100 AD2d 119, 122-123; 1 Schatkin, Disputed Paternity Proceedings § 8.08 [4th rev ed]), has made it more realistic to view a paternity proceeding as a means of actually and conclusively determining the identity of a child’s biological father (see, Matter of Commissioner of Social Servs. Moreover, with the joinder of William as an ""alleged father”, the court can order him to submit to a blood test (see, Family Ct Act § 532 [a]; CPLR 3121 [a]), the results of which, if they exclude him as the child’s father, will provide the clear and convincing evidence petitioner needs to rebut the presumption of legitimacy (see, e.g., Ghaznavi v Gordon, 163 AD2d 194, 195). Accordingly, where, as here, a mother’s husband has been a substantial presence in the child’s life and desires to continue to exercise parental rights, the need for joining him, as a party whose interests ""might be inequitably aifected by” the resulting order of filiation (CPLR 1001 [a]), is manifest and may be ordered by the court on its own motion (cf., Matter of Tyrone G. v Fifi N., 189 AD2d 8, 15-16; Albert C. v Joan C., 110 AD2d 803, 804). And if William refuses to submit to the test, an adverse inference may then be drawn against him (see, Fitzgerald v Tamola, 199 AD2d 122, 123; Matter of Joseph P.M. v Boyce R., 127 Misc 2d 931, 933-934). Family Court, following a hearing, found respondent’s admission that she had engaged in sexual relations with petitioner at the relevant time, coupled with results of a human leucocyte antigen test showing a 99.53% probability that petitioner is the child’s father, sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy that arises when a child is born to a married woman (see, Matter of Lane v Eno, 277 App Div 324, 325), and entered an order of filiation declaring petitioner to be the child’s father. v Duane HH., 95 AD2d 466, 467-468, affd 63 NY2d 859), the consequences of a proceeding of this type—both for the child and for the involved adults— are now considerably greater than they have been in the past (see, Matter of Cathleen P. v Gary P., 63 NY2d 805, 807; Matter of Kordek v Wood, 90 AD2d 209, 213). Matter of Tyrone G. v Fifi N., supra, at 14; cf., Matter of Cathleen P. v Gary P., 63 NY2d 805, 808, supra)."," In the case document provided, the main holding is that the joinder of William, as a respondent, will serve the child's interest in having her paternity decided swiftly and finally. By joining William as an ""alleged father"", the court can order him to submit to a blood test, which, if it excludes him from being the child's father, can provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of legitimacy. This is particularly important when the mother's husband has been a substantial presence in the child's life and desires to continue exercising parental rights. The court may order the joinder on its own motion, considering it necessary to protect the child's interests and to avoid inequitable effects on the parties involved.","In a case of disputed paternity, where a mother’s husband has been a substantial presence in the child’s life and desires to continue to exercise parental rights, the court may join the husband as a party in the case despite the presumption of legitimacy for a child born in a marriage."
"Upon being interrogated by relator’s counsel, Wood answered the first question by giving his name, but thereafter refused to answer any other question. Upon relator’s objection that Wood’s refusal to answer was improper, the respondent judge overruled the objection and sustained the right of the witness not to answer the questions. Relator then asked the respondent to ask the witness’ counsel to state the “rational basis” upon which the answers to the twenty-two questions might conceivably incriminate him. Respondent then invited Wood’s counsel to make such a statement. This was done, the witness stating that he would answer none of the questions. Respondent then adjourned the proceeding until the next day at which time he stated that he believed his ruling the previous day was correct, but that Cantor v. Saitz, 562 S.W.2d 774 (Mo.App.1978), was the controlling authority and that missing from the record was a statement in general terms by the judgment debtor or his counsel of a “rational basis” upon which the answers to relator’s questions could conceivably incriminate him. It was then agreed that relator’s counsel would read into the record all of his remaining questions and at the conclusion thereof ask the witness generally whether he would answer any of them. Caloia v. Weinstein, [525 S.W.2d 779, 780, 781 (Mo.App.1975)]: “ ‘ ... [T]he witness knows what the court cannot know and the witness must himself judge what the effect of his answer will be. 796, 801, 112 S.W.2d 113, 116 [1937], “In Gauss, supra, our supreme court went on to say that the principles set out in the Burr case, supra, are ‘ ... entirely consistent with the doctrine generally held, [and specifically followed in Missouri cases] that where the court can say, as a matter of law, that it is impossible that a witness would incriminate himself by answering a question one way or the other, then the court can require an answer .... ’ Ex parte Gauss, 223 Mo. 741, 742, our supreme court adopted the following excerpt from Justice Marshall’s oft-cited opinion: “ ‘[I]f the question be of such a description, that an answer to it may or may not criminate the witness, according to the purport of that answer, it must rest with himself, who alone can tell what it would be, to answer the question or not. It would seem, then, that the court ought never to compel a witness to give an answer which, discloses a fact that would form a necessary and essential part of a crime, which is punishable by the laws.’ State ex rel. Howard v. Allison, [431 S.W.2d 233, 237 (Mo.App.1968)]; State ex rel. Howard v. Allison, supra, [431 S.W.2d] at 237; State ex rel. We must dispose of the preliminary writ issued by the Court of Appeals. Caloia v. Weinstein, [525 S.W.2d 779, 780, 781 (Mo.App.1975)]: “ ‘ ... [T]he witness knows what the court cannot know and the witness must himself judge what the effect of his answer will be. By requiring the witness to state a “rational basis,” it is possible that the witness will “surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee.” Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. We believe this rule to be consistent with the principle, early expressed by Chief Justice Marshall in Burr, supra, that “it belongs to the court to consider and to decide whether any direct answer [to a question propounded] can implicate the witness,” for it will fall upon the court to decide whether the presumption has been rebutted and, therefore, whether the witness must answer the question. The only practicable solution is to be content with the door’s being set a little ajar, and while at times it permits the suppression of competent evidence, nothing better is available.” United States v. Weisman, 111 F.2d 260, 262 (2d Cir. The Court of Appeals, in Cantor, then noted that several Missouri cases, including Presta v. Owsley, supra, appeared to conflict with Gauss and Chief Justice Marshall’s discussion of the privilege in Burr, by imposing a “burden of proof” on the witness claiming the privilege to show that an answer to the question asked might tend to incriminate him. However, in order to assure that the protection given by Article I, § 19, of the Missouri Constitution, is meaningful, we hold that once a witness claims the privilege afforded him under that provision, a rebuttable presumption arises that the witness’ answer might tend to incriminate him, a presumption that can be rebutted by a demonstration by the party seeking the answer that such answer “ ‘cannot possibly’ have such tendency to incriminate.” Temple v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 892, 898 (1881), cited with approval in Hoffman v. United States, supra, 341 U.S. at 488-89, 71 S.Ct. can say, as a matter of law, that it is impossible that a witness would incriminate himself by answering a question one way or the other, then the court can require an answer .... ’ Ex parte Gauss, 223 Mo. of the United States Constitution,” North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 376, 99 S.Ct. Since the respondent applied the Cantor standard, we make the preliminary writ of prohibition issued by the Court of Appeals absolute, and prohibit respondent from proceeding further in a manner inconsistent with the standard enunciated in this opinion."," In this case, the witness Wood refused to answer questions during an interrogation session, asserting his right not to answer. Upon request by the relator, the respondent judge ruled that Wood's counsel should provide a ""rational basis"" justifying the possibility of incrimination resulting from answering the questions. After an absence, the respondent judge cited Cantor v. Saitz as the controlling authority and ruled that a ""rational basis"" should be given by the judgment debtor or his counsel to allow for the consideration of a self-incrimination protection claim. Following this, the witness still refused to answer any questions. The court holds that once a witness claims the privilege under the Missouri Constitution, a rebuttable presumption arises that the witness' answer might tend to incriminate him, which can be rebutted by a demonstration that the answer ""cannot possibly"" have such tendency to incriminate.","When assessing the privilege against self-incrimination, rather than requiring the witness to describe a rational basis for the incriminating nature of the testimony, the court should apply a rebuttable presumption that the testimony would be incriminating."
"Thus, we examine whether it was fundamentally unfair to conduct B.J.’s adjudication and disposition hearings in his absence.

In finding a violation of the juveniles’ due process rights, the Court of Appeals noted that there was not “any suggestion that the juveniles themselves expressed a conscious intent to relinquish their right to be present when the Commonwealth’s principal witness testified.” M.G., 75 S.W.3d at 721. Application of Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. See McKinney, 474 S.W.2d at 387 (in determining whether an absence was voluntary, “it is proper to tailor the requirements as to proof to the realities of the situation”). "," The holding in the case is that it was fundamentally unfair to conduct B.J.'s adjudication and disposition hearings in his absence, as there was no evidence of a conscious intent by the juveniles to relinquish their right to be present during the proceedings.","When a juvenile misses their court hearings despite having adequate notice and all other evidence suggests the absence is voluntarily, a court does not abuse its discretion by concluding that the juvenile has waived their right to appear."
"Next, Lisa points out that Theresa’s offer of judgment was tendered pursuant to NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115. See NRS 17.115(4). .” (Emphasis added.) .” (Emphasis added.) We disagree. We disagree. Therefore, Lisa is clearly incorrect when she argues that, pursuant to NRS 17.115, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees should be included in her judgment to determine whether her judgment is more favorable than Theresa’s offer of judgment. We hold that under either NRCP 68 or NRS 17.115, taxable costs, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest should not be included as part of a judgment to determine whether the judgment is greater than a previously tendered offer of judgment. Lisa argues this conclusion is warranted because of federal court interpretations of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 and because an offeree needs to be able to make an informed decision regarding the consequences of accepting or rejecting an offer of judgment made pursuant to NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115. Therefore, Lisa is clearly incorrect when she argues that, pursuant to NRS 17.115, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees should be included in her judgment to determine whether her judgment is more favorable than Theresa’s offer of judgment. The provisions of NRS 17.115(5) outline what can be included in a judgment when deciding whether the judgment is more favorable than an offer of judgment. Since Theresa’s offer of judgment was made pursuant to NRS 17.115 and NRCP 68, Lisa argues NRS 17.115(5) should be ignored, and pursuant to NRCP 68, her judgment should include prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees. Ironically, under Lisa’s analysis, however, she would not be entitled to attorney’s fees because her judgment, including attorney’s fees, would exceed the $20,000 statutory ceiling for attorney’s fees under NRS 18.010(2). The provisions of NRS 17.115(5) state that “[a]ny taxable costs, attorney’s fees and interest which is not derived from an interest-bearing obligation which may have been awarded must not be considered to be part of the judgment when determining whether the judgment was more favorable than the rejected offer.'"""," The holding states that under NRCP 68 or NRS 17.115, taxable costs, attorney's fees, and prejudgment interest should not be included as part of a judgment to determine whether the judgment is greater than a previously tendered offer of judgment. Furthermore, Lisa's argument that NRS 17.115 should be ignored and NRCP 68 provisions applied is incorrect, as it would render her ineligible for attorney's fees since her judgment, including these costs, would exceed the $20,000 statutory ceiling for attorney's fees under NRS 18.010(2).","Plaintiff's judgement of $10,500 does not include taxable costs, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest and therefore is not greater than the previously tendered offer of $17,001."

"At the investigator’s suggestion the son obtained from his cousin a writing, dated January 16, 1967, transferring ownership of the car to the father, and sent the paper to the insurer. The son duly reported the accident to the insurer, and on January 5, 1967, he gave the insurer’s investigator a full statement in writing, including the facts as to his purchase of the car. Also on February 28, 1966, a policy providing collision coverage on the second car was issued in the name of the father as owner. At some time before July 30, 1968, there was some communication between the insurer and the father and son about the insurer’s contention that it was not liable by reason of misrepresentation as to ownership. An indorsement to the policy changing the car was issued February 28, 1966, and on or before that date the father executed as owner an application for registration of the second car. The son bought a car on or about January 21, 1966, and had it registered and insured in his father’s name through the insurer’s agent in Pittsfield. The judge also found that the father, when he signed the application for registration of the second car, knew that it was being registered in his name as owner and that he was not the owner. 597, 602 (1961). 649, 658 (1961).

"We are asked to construe the group insurance policy to determine whether the appellant properly terminated the insured’s disability benefit payments as of December 31, 1979. On November 30, 1978, Middletown cancelled its group policy with Guardian Life effective December 1, 1978. In Turley, the insured died and his widow made a claim for a $1,000.00 insurance benefit under the terms of a group policy. The appellee argues that the insured’s right to benefits under the Guardian Life group policy fully vested at the time he became disabled, and the subsequent cancellation of the policy cannot divest that right. The policy in question provided for, inter alia, medical and health benefits coverage for employees of Middletown East End Warehouse Company (Middletown) who qualified under the group plan. He was insured under the group insurance policy issued by Guardian Life. The policy also provided: “In the event of total and permanent disability, occurring before the age of 60,____the____insurance----will become payable to the member himself in a single sum.” If total and permanent disability occurs after the age of 60, the insurance will be paid only when death occurs.” Id., 315 Pa. at 247, 173 A. at 164. The appellee argues that the insured’s right to benefits under the Guardian Life group policy fully vested at the time he became disabled, and the subsequent cancellation of the policy cannot divest that right. In upholding Turley’s widow’s right to the insurance benefit, we said: Undoubtedly this contention would be sound had not a member’s substantive right prior thereto become fixed. Indeed, subject to the terms of the policy, the disability of the insured activated his right to receive reimbursement for necessary medical expenses as such expenses were incurred. Under the terms of the policy, this obligation of the insurer and right of the insured was not dependent upon continuation of the insurance contract. Here, the right to benefits was otherwise terminated by the cancellation of the policy. In Turley, the insured died and his widow made a claim for a $1,000.00 insurance benefit under the terms of a group policy. The appellee argues that the appellant is liable for the payment of benefits until the policy limit of $250,000.00 is exhausted. The appellee argues that the appellant is liable for the payment of benefits until the policy limit of $250,000.00 is exhausted. Finally, the appellee argues that the appellant should be estopped from denying coverage until the policy limit of $250,000.00 is reached. Appellee’s contention is that because the memo states that the expense items set forth would be covered up to the policy limit, the appellant is estopped from denying coverage until that limit is exhausted. Accordingly, the argument goes on, the appellant should be estopped from denying payment of benefits up to the stated policy limit. The memo allegedly relied upon, written in response to a request made by appellee, merely informs appellee of the coverage under the policy. “The essential elements of estoppel are an inducement by the party sought to be estopped to the party who asserts the estoppel to believe certain facts to exist, and reliance by the party asserting the estoppel on that belief.” Sabino v. Junio, 441 Pa. 222, 272 A.2d 508 (1971). In the instant case, the appellee asserts that the appellant, by the memo of June 26, 1974, induced the appellee to believe the insured’s medical expenses would be covered up to the policy limit of $250,000.00, and that she and the insured justifiably relied upon that belief to her and the insured’s prejudices. We remand to the lower court to determine that covered expenses have been incurred by the appellant for her husband since December 31, 1979.” . The memo allegedly relied upon, written in response to a request made by appellee, merely informs appellee of the coverage under the policy. Appellant is entitled to have the expense covered by the disability benefits paid until the Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollar ($250,000.00) major medical allowance is exhausted. We find no prejudicial reliance on these facts. The insured was declared incompetent on April 15, 1975. ."," The insured's right to benefits under the Guardian Life group policy fully vested at the time he became disabled, and the subsequent cancellation of the policy cannot divest that right. Under the terms of the policy, this obligation of the insurer and right of the insured was not dependent upon continuation of the insurance contract.","Where the insured's policy clearly states a termination date for benefits, and where there the terms are not contrary to public policy and estoppel is not applicable, the insurer may terminate vested benefits in accordance with that policy, regardless of whether the benefit limit has been reached."
"The allowance of interest under §6013(1) is mandatory, Goins v Ford Motor Co, 131 Mich App 185, 201-202; 347 NW2d 184 (1983), lv den 424 Mich 879 (1986), while in equitable actions, the question of interest is a discretionary matter for the trial court. However, in its first amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant had been billed for surveillance fees for 1974 in the amount of $8,000. On March 20, 1987, plaintiff filed this action to collect the interest on the judgment entered against defendant on August 28, 1981. Furthermore, the award of interest pursuant to § 6013 would effectuate the legislative purpose of compensating plaintiff for its loss of use of the surveillance fees, the majority of which were due and owing well before the trial court’s order. On April 8, 1986, plaintiff billed defendant for the unpaid surveillance fees from 1975 to 1984 and sought interest owed on the unpaid fees pursuant to MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. Here, the trial court’s August 28, 1981, order stated: It is further ordered that defendant and Intervening defendant pay any and all delinquent Surveillance Fees due and owing as of the date of this order .... On its face, the order was clearly a money judgment. In Hendrickson v Moghissi, 158 Mich App 290, 295; 404 NW2d 728 (1987), this Court stated: [T]he Michigan Constitution vests the circuit court with broad original jurisdiction over all matters, particularly civil, so long as jurisdiction is not expressly prohibited by law. Fifth, defendant contends that plaintiff’s claim for interest is barred by the- statute of limitations and, although defendant refers to MCL 600.5801 et seq. Fourth, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that plaintiff had the legal capacity to bring an independent action for the interest on the judgment, because the collection of interest is not an authorized activity under either MCL 14.131 et seq. Therefore, the prior judgment does not act to bar litigating the issue of interest; rather, it is the basis on which plaintiff is entitled to interest under § 6013. Defendant argues that plaintiff was barred from litigating the issue of interest, because no payment of interest was ordered in the 1981 judgment. ; MSA 27A.5801 et seq., it does not specify the statute of limitations which applies here. Thus, plaintiff’s action for interest was within the applicable statute of limitations. Although defendant suggests that the period of limitation was six years, MCL 600.5809(3); MSA 27A.5809(3) provides that the period of limitations is ten years ""for actions founded upon judgments or decrees rendered in a court of record of this state . Finally, defendant contends that the trial court erred in not specifying in its order the amount of interest owed to plaintiff and in ordering the payment of interest at the statutory rate set forth in § 6013(2). Because the amended complaint was filed before June 1, 1980, computation of the interest owed by defendant was proper under § 6013(2). Defendant points out that plaintiff did not seek surveillance fees for any year other than 1974, and argues that, as a result, any claim for interest on the unpaid surveillance fees for 1975 through the date of the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations. Furthermore, the complaint to which § 6013(2) refers can only be plaintiff’s amended complaint, filed on March 7, 1977, which alleged that defendant was required to pay, and owed, surveillance fees."," The holding in this case is that the award of interest under §6013 would effectuate the legislative purpose of compensating plaintiff for its loss of use of the surveillance fees. The majority of which were due and owing well before the trial court's order. The trial court's August 28, 1981 order is a money judgment and plaintiff is entitled to interest under §6013. The action for interest was within the applicable statute of limitations, which is ten years ""for actions founded upon judgments or decrees rendered in a court of record of this state."" Additionally, computation of the interest owed by the defendant was proper under §6013(2).","A judgment for unpaid fees was a monetary judgment and thus subject to the statute for relative interest, even though plaintiff originally only sought declaratory relief because the plaintiff also asked the court for payment of fees owed. Further, the interest applies to ""all monies due"", not just the fees for the single year originally sought by plaintiff"
"The plaintiff also alleges that because of procedural defects, the defendants’ decision to terminate the plaintiff constituted an unlawful exercise of administrative power and “was in violation of Section 5-6-7 [sic], N.M.S.A., 1953 Comp.,” and in violation of the regulations of the Los Alamos Schools. Plaintiff also alleges that the non-renewal of plaintiff’s employment was founded on plaintiff’s expression of opinion on subjects of public interest relating to the Los Alamos school system, and the termination of employment and refusal to reemploy for such reason constitutes a deprivation of plaintiff’s right to freedom of speech protected by the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. Plaintiff further alleges that the Board’s decision to terminate her employment was made at a special meeting of the Board on May 18, 1971, which was reconvened into an alleged open meeting which was in fact procedurally defective and in violation of § 5-6-17, N.M.S.A., 1953, and the Los Ala-mos Schools Regulations. 44376, Santa Fe County District Court, which was a dismissal without prejudice of a suit involving identical parties and issues, did not make this matter res judicata; (2) that the plaintiff did not fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; (3) that this matter is not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; and (4) that the trial court erred in ruling that the defendant school board was not a person within the language of 42 U. S.C. § 1983. § 1983 (1970), because of defendants’ refusal to reemploy the plaintiff as a certified classroom teacher at Los Alamos High School for the school year 1971-1972 and thereafter. Thereafter, defendants Board, board members and its superintendent filed motions to dismiss on grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted, that the matter was res judicata because of a previous suit, and that an action pursuant to 42 U.S,C. Plaintiff claims that the Board’s action to terminate and refusal to reemploy her was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the objective expectancy of reemployment possessed by the plaintiff. That cause was heard by District Judge Edwin L. Fel-ter and he dismissed the complaint without prejudice. the trial court’s judgment in proper perspective, it should be pointed out that prior to the instant cause being filed in Los Alamos County District Court, the same plaintiff had filed a complaint seeking a mandatory injunction and money damages in the District Court of Santa Fe County in cause No. All the grounds of recovery, all the basis of plaintiff’s title, must be presented in the first action, or they are lost to him forever.’ ” We feel that the dismissal of the suit filed in the Santa Fe County District Court became final and binding when no amended pleadings were filed in the time given, and no appeal was taken from that court’s ruling. The ruling of the trial court is affirmed. In Board v. Cross, supra, we quoted from Judge Brewer’s opinion in Patterson v. Wold, 33 F. 791 (D.Minn.1888), as follows (12 N.M. at 78, 73 P. at 617): “ ‘It is true, the basis of complainant’s primary right is, as alleged, different in one case from that in the other; but this is mere difference, in the language of the Supreme Court, “in the grounds of recovery.” The mere fact that different testimony would be necessary to sustain the different allegations in the two bills, does not of itself, necessarily make two distinct causes of action ... The same order of dismissal by Judge Felter contained the following language : “At the election of the Plaintiff, she shall have 20 days from the date of this Order to file an Amended Complaint in this cause.” In addition, Judge Felter’s decision in the Santa Fe County case was based on his holding that the plaintiff was not a tenure teacher, that her claim of entitlement to employment is “merely a unilateral expectation, and therefore, the Complaint filed herein fails to state a cause of action * * We first need to consider the effect of Judge Felter’s decision in the Santa Fe County District Court case dismissing the action “without prejudice” and which also gave plaintiff an election to file an amended complaint within twenty days. In Chavez v. Myers, 11 N.M. 333, 68 P. 917 (1902), we ruled that a party to an action who does not appeal is presumed to be satisfied with the judgment rendered by the court below. "," The plaintiff alleges that the defendant school board's decision to terminate her employment was based on her speech on matters of public interest, a violation of her right to freedom of speech protected by the US and New Mexico Constitutions. The plaintiff also alleges procedural defects in the board's decision-making process, a violation of Section 5-6-7, and the Los Alamos Schools Regulations. The plaintiff claims the board's action was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious and in violation of the objective expectancy of reemployment. However, the dismissal of the suit filed in the Santa Fe County District Court became final and binding when no amended pleadings were filed and no appeal was taken from that court's ruling, and the trial court's judgment is affirmed.","The dismissal of the suit filed by the plaintiff in a different court on substantially the same issues became final and binding when no amended pleadings were filed in the time given, and no appeal was taken from that court’s ruling, so the decision by the court to dismiss plaintiff's case on the grounds of res judicata was proper."
"The circuit court found there was substantial evidence to support the finding that Stephenson was totally disabled prior to his accident, and affirmed the Commission. The Full Commission reversed the commissioner, finding as follows: [Stephenson] was already permanently and totally disabled prior to his work-related accident on March 16, 1988. Thus, excluding the VA rating from consideration, the issue becomes whether substantial evidence exists to support the Commission’s finding that Stephenson was already permanently disabled prior to his work-related accident on March 16, 1988. On appeal, Stephenson argues the Commission impermissibly relied upon the VA rating in denying his claim, and that the finding of total disability from PTSD prior to the accident was not otherwise supported by substantial evidence. Cureton, Judge: Claimant Marvin Stephenson appeals the denial of workers’ compensation benefits and the finding of the Full Commission that his work-related injury did not aggravate his pre-existing condition because he was already totally disabled from this disorder prior to his accident. 1990) (the Commission’s decision must be affirmed if the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence); see also McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, 307 S.C. 184, 414 S.E. As pointed out by the circuit court, Rice Services contends the disability rating given to Stephenson by the VA was not the sole evidence relied upon by the Commission in concluding that Stephenson was already permanently and totally disabled prior to his accident on March 16, 1988. 1989) Furthermore, as stated in Outlaw v. Johnson Service Co., 254 S.C. 486, 176 S.E (2d) 152 (1970), the loss of earning capacity alone is the criterion for compensation under the Act and medical opinion as to the extent of physical disability can have no probative value against actual earnings. We agree with the single commissioner that the inescapable fact remains that Stephenson was able to find not only one, but two jobs within his limitations and he was able to perform the duties of that employment up until his injury. The undisputed fact that Stephenson w;as able to resume gainful employment and satisfactorily performed his job negates the finding that on March 16,1988 Stephenson had no earning capacity. Walls Construction Company, 241 Kan. 588, 738 P. (2d) 445 (1987); see also 2 Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen’s Compensation § 59.42(g)(3) (1993) (“The capacities of a human being cannot be arbitrarily and finally divided and written off by percentages.” If a disabled worker is able to resume gainful employment and is later injured, there is no reason why a disability which would bring anyone else total permanent disability benefits should yield him none). The record shows that Stephenson retained some earning capacity before his injury, and the accident and injury of March 16, 1988 aggravated his pre-existing PTSD rendering him totally and permanently disabled."," The court held that the Commission's decision can be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence, as in this case, it was. The fact that Stephenson resumed gainful employment after his initial disability did not negate his status as totally disabled prior to his work-related accident on March 16, 1988. The court agreed with the Commission's finding that the disability rating given by the VA was not the sole basis for their decision, and that substantial evidence supported their conclusion that Stephenson was already permanently and totally disabled before the accident due to PTSD.","Where plaintiff adduced evidence that he was successfully able to work two jobs despite the prior conclusion of the Veteran's Authority psychologist to the contrary that he was 100% disabled by PTSD, there is no substantial evidence that Stephenson was totally disabled at the time of the accident, and thus he is not barred from worker's compensation."
"He denied starting the fire. Thus, that conviction does not warrant reversal. During the State’s case-in-chief the prosecutor elicited the following comments from Deputy Sims on direct examination: Q. After signing the consent, Kreijanovsky, Sims, and Banks went to the appellant’s home where fruits of the burglary were seized along with a gas can, which was the only physical evidence linking the appellant to the fire. As to the burglary, the evidence presented No, sir, not until we started talking to him. No, sir, not pertaining to the fire or anything. We hold that 21 O.S.1981, § 1401 allows a conviction for the willful burning of a building or structure presently used for lodging, notwithstanding the absence of occupants at the time of the fire. The appellant also alleges that the trial court’s failure to instruct, sua sponte, on the issue of voluntary intoxication was fundamental error, because the appellant’s testimony that he had consumed five quarts of beer negated the specific intent element of the crimes charged. As to the burglary, the evidence presented in the instant case regarding the appellant’s intoxication was insufficient to require an instruction. Next the appellant contends that a conviction for First Degree Arson cannot be soundly based when no one was actually in the home during the blaze. The appellant further complains that photographs of the scene of the fire were improperly admitted and that evidence of other crimes was introduced without following the rules of Burks v. State, 594 P.2d 771 (Okl.Cr.1979). The appellant requested counsel when the discussion turned to the arson charge. As appellant’s testimony negated the defense by demonstrating he was in control of his mental faculties, the court’s failure to instruct, sua sponte, on voluntary intoxication was not error. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). The appellant requested counsel when the discussion turned to the arson charge. at 474, 86 S.Ct. Such interrogation cannot occur after a defendant has invoked the right to counsel. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 436, 86 S.Ct. The question presented is whether requesting an accused who is in custody to execute a consent-to-search form after he has invoked his right to counsel is tantamount to interrogation and violative of his Miranda rights."," The holding is that the appellant's conviction for the willful burning of a building or structure presently used for lodging, as per 21 O.S. 1981, § 1401, is valid, even if there were no occupants present at the time of the fire. Additionally, the trial court's failure to instruct on the issue of voluntary intoxication was not found to be fundamental error. The appellant's claims regarding insufficient evidence for intoxication instruction and improper introduction of photographs and evidence of other crimes were dismissed.",HOLDING1: The prosecutor's repeated questions to the witness during direct examination on the defendant's refusal to answer questions after invoking his Miranda rights was prejudicial and had no probative value. It was therefore harmful to the defendant's case on the arson count and warrants reversal. HOLDING2: The state violated defendant's 5th Amendment Miranda rights and his rights under the state constitution when it elicited his consent to search his home after he had invoked his right to an attorney. 
"We conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that Arata could attach student loan funds that Brindle deposited into her bank account. On March 22, 2010, National City responded that Brindle had $3367.01 in her account at the time the interrogatories were filed. On March 26, 2010, the trial court denied Brindle's exemption claim in part, ordering National City Bank to send to the Allen County Clerk of Courts all funds in Brindle's account save $300.00. The trial court concluded that Brindle's student loan funds lost their exempt status when she deposited the funds in her private account, on the basis that there was no federal law specifically saying that they retained their exempt status when so disposed of. Moreover, neither party directs our attention to any case law that might support a conclusion that deposit in a bank account automatically terminates the exempt status of student loan funds under federal law. Simply put, the plain language of section 1095a exempts student loan funds and property traceable to those funds from garnishment or attachment, and there is no provision to which either party points us, or of which we are aware, that terminates this status, whether by deposit in a personal bank account or otherwise. Because we conclude that the student loan funds at issue here may not be attached to satisfy a judgment, we reverse. Brosamer simply does not apply here. Brosamer, however, is inapposite. We reverse the judgment of the trial court."," The trial court erred in ruling that Arata could attach student loan funds deposited into Brindle's bank account. Federal law exempts student loan funds and property traceable to those funds from garnishment or attachment, and there is no provision to terminate this status upon deposit into a personal bank account.",Money from defendant's student loans that were deposited into her personal account and mixed with other funds retained there exempt status and therefore the court erred when it garnished those funds to pay for a judgement against the defendant.
"Based upon the affidavits presented, the trial court found that no binding contract had been made with reference thereto. In the absence of such an agreement, it follows that the payments made by the university were purely voluntary. As to him personally the promise would be within the statute of frauds.” Under these principles, it is clear that no personal obligation rested upon Meyers to refund the taxes thus paid by the university. At the time of the commencement of these proceedings, there was a balance of $1,197.81 due on said contract. After the trial court had made its order for judgment, but before judgment was entered, the state moved for an order reducing the verdict by an amount equal to certain payments made by the university, one for $146.33 covering 1945 taxes on Meyers’ one-third interest in the real estate described, and one covering the balance of $1,197.81 due on Meyers’ contract of repurchase with the state. The university further asserted in such affidavits that the payments were made by it under an oral agreement with Meyers whereby it was to make such payments to stop interest thereon, and that it was thereafter to deduct the amounts thereof from any award ultimately rendered in favor of Meyers. On April 18 of that year, the commissioners made- awards to Meyers for his property totaling $4,343.30. As to him personally the promise would be within the statute of frauds.” Under these principles, it is clear that no personal obligation rested upon Meyers to refund the taxes thus paid by the university. It follows that at the time of the hearing on appeal in district court there existed no tax lien on the property. The state now asserts that, in any event, under the law of restitution, it should be reimbursed for the payments thus made, contending that they were made under an erroneous belief induced by a mistake of fact that it was thereby releasing its own property from the lien. It is true that had the taxes remained unpaid at the time of the entry of the judgment they would then constitute a lien thereon, since the damages awarded stood in place of the property taken. However, payment therefor was made and the tax lien discharged long prior to the award of the jury on appeal to the district court. As a volunteer paying the taxes of Meyers, the state could not make him its debtor so as to require of him restitution for the amounts paid."," The trial court found that no binding contract existed between the university and Meyers regarding the taxes paid. Without a valid contract, the payments made by the university were voluntary, and no personal obligation was placed on Meyers to refund the taxes. Furthermore, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, there was a balance due on Meyers' contract of repurchase with the state. The state asserts that they should be reimbursed under the law of restitution, claiming they made payments under a mistake of fact. However, in this case, as a volunteer paying the taxes of Meyers, the state could not make him liable for restitution.","Where the state adduced no evidence of a purported oral contract by appellee to repay taxes that it paid on his behalf, appellee had no obligation to do so under contract, personal obligation, or restitution theories."
"695, 35 N. W. 2d 772, the defendants challenge here the sufficiency of the reason given by the trial court for sustaining the motion. In that case, the trial court failed to define proximate cause in its instructions. Plaintiffs, in accord with the rule in the Greenberg case, supra, submit as an additional reason to sustain the trial court’s judgment, the failure of thq court.to define. Defendants challenge the applicability of that case, pointing out that there the verdict was for the plaintiff, while here it was for the defendants. In the journal entry, the court states: “* * * the judgment was vacated for the reason that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, * * Defendants appeal. They contend that it was error without prejudice to the plaintiffs inasmuch as proximate cause is a limiting factor of benefit to the defendants. “In an action to recover damages caused by alleged negligence, plaintiff must prove both negligence of defendant and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury complained of.” Sippel v. Missouri Pacific Ry. In that case, the trial court failed to define proximate cause in its instructions. For the reasons given herein, the judgment of the court in granting a new trial is affirmed. 47, 18 N. W. 2d 551. The answer to this question is found in Kielley v. Mc-Cauley, 139 Neb. There the court correctly defined the meaning of proximate cause, but did not thereafter use it in the instructions. Defendants challenge the applicability of that case, pointing out that there the verdict was for the plaintiff, while here it was for the defendants. It is sufficient if it appears that defendants’ negligence was the sole cause, or the efficient cause, or was the direct cause.” We there analyzed the instructions and held them sufficient."," In the given case, the trial court failed to define proximate cause in its instructions, leading to the challenge by the defendants on the sufficiency of the given reason for sustaining the motion. The plaintiffs argue that the failure to define proximate cause is an additional reason to sustain the trial court's judgment, based on the rule in the Greenberg case. However, the defendants dispute this applicability, noting the difference in verdict outcomes in the two cases. The court ultimately affirms the judgment of granting a new trial for the failure to define proximate cause in the trial court's instructions.","Where there is a question of whether and to what extent the negligence of both plaintiff and defendant was the proximate cause of the injury in the case, failure to give a jury instruction defining proximate cause is a prejudicial error warranting a new trial. "
