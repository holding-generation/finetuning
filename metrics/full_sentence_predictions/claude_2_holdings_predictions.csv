"Calhoun, Judge:
In this action in assumpsit, Everette Waitman Christian sued the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in the Circuit Court of Wyoming County on a policy of insurance, covering a Mercury automobile. From a judgment for the plaintiff, the defendant prosecutes this writ of error.
The automobile in question was purchased by the plaintiff in November, 1956, from Welch Lincoln-Mercury Sales Agency of Welch, McDowell County, West Virginia. The unpaid balance on the purchase price, amounting to $2,600.00, was financed through Commercial Credit Corporation. Marvin King, who made the sale on behalf of Welch Lincoln-Mercury Sales Agency, called Margaret E. Foster, insurance agent of the defendant, by telephone at her place of business in Welch. As a result of the telephone conversation, the plaintiff called upon Mrs. Foster, who issued the insurance policy in question.
With reference to the loss, the plaintiff testified that about 11:30 a. m., on December 17, 1956, he was proceeding alone in his automobile on Big Cub Creek Road in Wyoming County, when, at a certain point on Coal Mountain, the right rear tire became flat; that he parked his automobile on the right side of the highway; that while he was in the process of changing tires, the “car crawled over the jack”, and the automobile went over a steep and rocky hill or bank at the right of and below the highway, resulting in practically a complete loss of the vehicle; that thereafter he walked about two miles to a beer tavern where he telephoned for a wrecker; that he returned promptly to the scene; and that in the meantime the jack had disappeared.
Mrs. Margaret E. Foster filled in the blanks on the application for insurance. One of the questions on the application was: “Has any insurer cancelled or refused to issue or renew automobile insurance to the applicant or any member of his household within the past three years ?” This question was answered in the negative on the application, and the plaintiff signed the application with such answer appearing thereon. The plaintiff testified that he told Mrs. Foster “I had had insurance canceled”, but that “she told me that she would put no on there, that it would go through anyhow.” On the other hand, Mrs. Foster testified that she undertook to impress Christian with the vital importance of the question, but that he nevertheless stated to her that he had never had automoible insurance cancelled or refused.
French Lilly of Oceana, in Wyoming County, an agent for the defendant company, testified that “in the neighborhood of July in 1956”, the plaintiff showed to the witness a letter disclosing that the plaintiff’s automobile insurance with another company was being cancelled and that thereupon the witness refused to write a policy of insurance on behalf of the defendant company covering plaintiff’s automobile. French Lilly further testified that some time thereafter the policy written by Mrs. Foster was mailed to him, inasmuch as plaintiff also resided in Wyoming County, and that he thereupon mailed the policy to the plaintiff, not at that time being aware of the fact that the policy was written for the same man who had been refused insurance previously by the witness. In the meantime, the plaintiff had an accident involving a collision of his automobile with a cow. This was brought to the attention of the witness at his office at Oceana, and he went to plaintiff’s home to call upon him. It was then for the first time that French Lilly, according to his testimony, identified the plaintiff as the man for whom he had previously refused to write automobile insurance. The witness testified that he asked the plaintiff whether or not he had told Mrs. Foster that previously he had been refused insurance, and that the plaintiff replied that Mrs. Foster “never asked me that question.”
During December, 1956, the home office of the defendant company at Charlottesville, Virginia, received a confidential credit report relating to the plaintiff. As a consequence thereof, the home office wrote a letter to the plaintiff, dated December 20, 1956, three days after the automobile was demolished, notifying the plaintiff that his insurance policy would be cancelled as of January 2, 1957, and advising him to obtain proper insurance in the meantime with another company. At the time the letter of December 20 was written, the home office did not know of the accident involving the cow, or of the occurrence which resulted in the destruction of the automobile, and did not know of the fact that the application made by plaintiff contained a false statement of facts. Later, however, the home office learned of the false answer contained in the application; and on March 8, 1957, wrote a letter to the plaintiff detailing the facts in relation to the false answer contained in the application, and notifying the plaintiff that his insurance policy was rescinded. A refund of the premium was made to the plaintiff. The defendant offered the letter of March 8 for introduction in evidence, the plaintiff objected, and the court refused to permit the introduction of such letter as a part of the evidence to be considered by the jury. The defendant, however, in order to save the point, took testimony in relation to the letter outside the presence and hearing of the jury, and the letter was made a part of the record.
After the completion of the testimony at the trial before a jury, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict in its favor, which motion was overruled. Thereupon, the court made the following statement to the jury:
“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there are two questions to be decided in this case. One is a question of law and the court has to decide that. The other is a question of fact and the jury has that to decide. By agreement of counsel you will be submitted one question only, what was the fair market value of this vehicle at the time of the loss of it. A verdict has been prepared for you with the amount in dollars left blank. I will ask you to take this, go to your room, select a foreman, and when you have agreed upon a verdict, come back into court.”
The final order contains the following language:
“* * * Thereupon the Court and the jury heard the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff and that on behalf of the defendant, and at the conclusion of all the evidence, it was agreed and the Court ruled and announced its ruling to the jury that the question of liability was a question of law for the Court to decide and that the jury should inquire only as to the market value of the automobile in question and the jury retired to its room to consider said inquiry of damage and after a time returned with the verdict in the following words and figures:
‘By agreement of counsel and upon direction of the Court, we the jury agree and find that the fair market value of the vehicle which is the subject matter of this controversy at the time of the loss was $2,800.00.—
Henry M. Houck’
“Whereupon the verdict of the jury was received and the jury was discharged from further service in this cause and the Court took time to consider of its ruling on the issue of liability as a matter of law and after the submission of written briefs by counsel for plaintiff and counsel for the defendant, the Court rendered its written opinion, which said opinion is hereby ordered filed as part of the record hereof and by which said written opinion the Court doth find and so adjudge that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict against the defendant in the sum of $271.45, being the market value of the automobile in question as found by the jury’s verdict less the amount of the mortgabe previously paid to the mortgagee, and the plaintiff is also awarded interest and his costs herein expended, to which ruling of the Court, the defendant excepts.”
It is obvious, therefore, that counsel for the parties, with the concurrence of the court, stipulated and agreed that the only question of fact was the fair market value of the automobile at the time of its destruction and that the question of liability was one of law for the court.
The defendant paid Commercial Credit Corporation, the innocent mortgagee, the sum of $2,528.55. The trial court deducted this sum from $2,800.00, the value placed on the automobile by the jury’s verdict, and entered judgment for the plaintiff for the balance, amounting to $271.45. In his written opinion, which was made a part of the record, the eminent trial judge stated:
“I am of the opinion that the knowledge of the agent of the company at Oceana is imputed to its principal, the defendant company, and the defendant company having had knowledge of a prior cancellation through its agent and in its principal offices, had an election to either treat the policy as void or rescind it as of a future date. The company elected to rescind and prior to the date of rescinding, the loss occurred.”
Prior to the time of the trial, the defendant filed its specification of defense in accordance with the provisions of Code, 56-4-21, a portion of which was as follows: “That the plaintiff fraudulently procured the said policy of insurance by the wilful, intentional, making of false and fraudulent answers and misrepresentations upon his application for said policy of insurance, with full knowledge at the time of making said false statements and answers that the defendant would not have issued said policy of insurance had the defendant known that the statements and answers as given were false. That said false representations were to the effect that the plaintiff had not been involved in any previous accidents and that he had not had any previous automobile insurance can-celled, nor had any insurance company previously refused to insure him on such automobile insurance.” Thereupon, the plaintiff had the right to, but did not, file a statement in writing stating his intention to rely upon matters of waiver or estoppel, in accordance with the provisions of Code, 56-4-22, a portion of which statute is as follows: “But if the plaintiff intends to rely upon any matter in waiver, estoppel, or in confession and avoidance of any matter which may have been stated by the defendant as aforesaid, the plaintiff must file a statement in writing, specifying in general terms the matter on which he intends so to rely; and such statement must be verified by the oath of the plaintiff, or some other credible person, to the effect that the affiant believes the matter of reply therein stated will be supported by evidence at the trial.” These statutory provisions are mandatory. Rubenstein v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 118 W. Va. 867, 372, 190 S. E. 531, 534. “Plaintiff cannot, at the trial or in the appellate court, rely on an estoppel not set forth in his reply.” Capehart v. Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Ass’n., 111 W. Va. 317, syl., 161 S. E. 609. See also Duncan v. Federal Union Insurance Co., 113 W. Va. 71, 166 S. E. 813. We need not decide whether or not the knowledge of defendant’s agent in Wyoming County may be imputed to the defendant, so as to form the basis of waiver or estoppel, though the policy was written by another agent residing in another county. See Kincaid v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U. S., 116 W. Va. 672, pt. 2 syl., 183 S. E. 40. Under the statute and prior decisions of this Court, the plaintiff filed no pleading to form the basis of a defense based on waiver or estoppel.
Where an applicant for insurance imparts correct information but the agent, without the knowledge of the applicant, records the answers incorrectly, parol evidence may be introduced to show such facts. The acts of the agent under such circumstances are binding upon the insurer. But it is otherwise if the applicant knows that the facts are recorded falsely in the application. SchWarzbach v. Ohio Valley Protective Union, 25 W. Va. 622, syl. 12, and page 668; Deitz v. Insurance Company, 31 W. Va. 851, 857, 8 S. E. 616, 620; Shinn v. West Virginia Insurance Co., 104 W. Va. 353, pt. 2 syl., 140 S. E. 61; Kincaid v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of the U. S., 116 W. Va. 672, 676, 183 S. E. 40, 43. “The insurer is not precluded from setting up the falsity of answers in the application where it appears that insured knew at the time they were being written or before signing the application that they were written falsely in order to defraud the company.” 45 C.J.S., Insurance, Section 732, page 741. See also 29 Am. Jur., Insurance, Section 847, page 650. “The insurer is not estopped to avoid the policy where both the applicant and the insurer’s agent know that material answers contained in the application are false.” New York Life Ins. Co. v. Eicher, 198 Va. 255, 93 S. E. 2d 269, 274. “No agent has power to perpetrate a fraud upon his principal. If the applicant knows that there are misrepresentations in the answer as written and that they are material, there is fraud in the inducement when a policy is issued upon their faith. He cannot depend upon the power of the agent, in the language of the street, to put it over.” Mutual Ben. Health & Accident v. Ratcliffe, 163 Va. 325, 175 S. E. 870, 874. Giving the plaintiff’s testimony the most favorable construction, it cannot avail him because of the fact that he admits that he knew the answer was false when it was written and when he signed the application.
The false answer related to a vitally material matter. 45 C.J.S., Insurance, Section 605, page 438. A reasonable inference from plaintiff’s testimony is that he recognized that the policy would not have been issued had the application contained a truthful answer.
Fraud on the part of the insured in the procurement of the policy, or a false statement by the insured relative to a material fact in the application therefor is sufficient to defeat a recovery in an action on such policy. “An insurance company may avoid liability on a policy obtained through the fraud of insured or of his agent, except, * * * where the circumstances establish a waiver of, or an estoppel to assert, such fraud. Although in some jurisdictions it is held that a contract of insurance procured by fraud is void, as a general rule, such a contract is voidable at the option of insurer on discovery of the fraud.” 45 C.J.S., Insurance, Section 473(2), page 152. See also 29 Am. Jur., Insurance, Section 524, page 422. It has been held that, under such circumstances, “the policy will ordinarily be forfeited.” Faulkiner v. Equitable Life Insurance Co., 144, W. Va. 193, syl., 107 S. E. 2d 360. It has been held also that the policy under such circumstances is rendered “void”. Cook v. Farmers Mut. Life Ass’n of W. Va., 139 W. Va. 700, pt. 1 syl., 81 S. E. 2d 71. It has been held that, under such a state of facts, “the policy is thereby forfeited.” Saltesz v. The Sovereign Camp of the Woodmen of the World, 110 W. Va. 513, syl., 159 S. E. 513. Perhaps it would be more logical to say that the policy, under such circumstances, is voidable at the option of the insurer, inasmuch as the policy may be given vitality by a factual situation amounting to a waiver or estoppel on the part of the insurer. No matter what the accurate terminology may be, it is clear that, in the absence of pleadings and proof disclosing waiver or estoppel, the false statement by the insured relative to a material fact in the application is sufficient to defeat recovery. Therefore, the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict, made at the conclusion of all the testimony, should have been sustained.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Wyoming County is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.
Judgment reversed; verdict set aside; new trial awarded.","Here is a concise holding from the case document:

The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that the plaintiff's admittedly false statement in his insurance application regarding a material fact precludes his recovery under the policy, absent pleadings and proof of waiver or estoppel by the insurer. The judgment for the plaintiff is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.","Plaintiff's false statement that he had not previously had his insurance canceled or refused was sufficient to defeat his claim, and defendant's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted on these grounds."
"OPINION OF THE COURT
Yesawich Jr., J.
Petitioner maintains that he is the father of a daughter born to respondent on April 29, 1993. Respondent, who married her present husband, William Y., in November 1992, admits to having had unprotected sexual intercourse with both petitioner and William on different occasions near the probable date of conception. Family Court, following a hearing, found respondent’s admission that she had engaged in sexual relations with petitioner at the relevant time, coupled with results of a human leucocyte antigen test showing a 99.53% probability that petitioner is the child’s father, sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy that arises when a child is born to a married woman (see, Matter of Lane v Eno, 277 App Div 324, 325), and entered an order of filiation declaring petitioner to be the child’s father. Respondent appeals.
Although neither party has raised the issue, petitioner’s claim, which was promptly pressed, cannot fairly be resolved without first having William joined as a party respondent. Historically, neither the child whose paternity was at issue nor the mother’s husband has been deemed a necessary party to a paternity proceeding (see, Commissioner of Pub. Welfare of City of N. Y. v Koehler, 284 NY 260, 267). However, this principle was premised upon the fact that, when it was embraced a paternity proceeding had no effect on the child’s legal status, but was intended only as a means of securing support (see, supra, at 266-267). In the interim, however, the Legislature amended Family Court Act § 522 to include ""a person alleging to be the father” as a proper petitioner to commence a paternity proceeding (L 1976, ch 665, § 6, eff Jan. 1, 1977). As a result of this amendment ""and numerous other laws conferring rights and benefits flowing from an order of filiation” (Matter of Sharon GG. v Duane HH., 95 AD2d 466, 467-468, affd 63 NY2d 859), the consequences of a proceeding of this type—both for the child and for the involved adults— are now considerably greater than they have been in the past (see, Matter of Cathleen P. v Gary P., 63 NY2d 805, 807; Matter of Kordek v Wood, 90 AD2d 209, 213). This, along with the development of accurate scientific methods for demonstrating the nonpaternity of a large majority of males who are not actually the father (see, Matter of Department of Social Servs. [Sandra C.] v Thomas J.S., 100 AD2d 119, 122-123; 1 Schatkin, Disputed Paternity Proceedings § 8.08 [4th rev ed]), has made it more realistic to view a paternity proceeding as a means of actually and conclusively determining the identity of a child’s biological father (see, Matter of Commissioner of Social Servs. [Celia D.] v Hector S., — AD2d —, 1995 NY Slip OP 05763 [1st Dept, June 13, 1995]; Matter of Gorton v Gorton, 123 Misc 2d 1034, 1036).
Accordingly, where, as here, a mother’s husband has been a substantial presence in the child’s life and desires to continue to exercise parental rights, the need for joining him, as a party whose interests ""might be inequitably aifected by” the resulting order of filiation (CPLR 1001 [a]), is manifest and may be ordered by the court on its own motion (cf., Matter of Tyrone G. v Fifi N., 189 AD2d 8, 15-16; Albert C. v Joan C., 110 AD2d 803, 804).
Moreover, with the joinder of William as an ""alleged father”, the court can order him to submit to a blood test (see, Family Ct Act § 532 [a]; CPLR 3121 [a]), the results of which, if they exclude him as the child’s father, will provide the clear and convincing evidence petitioner needs to rebut the presumption of legitimacy (see, e.g., Ghaznavi v Gordon, 163 AD2d 194, 195). And if William refuses to submit to the test, an adverse inference may then be drawn against him (see, Fitzgerald v Tamola, 199 AD2d 122, 123; Matter of Joseph P.M. v Boyce R., 127 Misc 2d 931, 933-934). This is not to suggest that the presumption of legitimacy should not continue to govern when the truth cannot be known with reasonable certainty (as, for example, if the blood test results do not rule out William as the child’s father). But if the truth can be discovered, and equity does not demand otherwise, the presumption should not be utilized to perpetuate a falsehood (see, Matter of Constance G. v Herbert Lewis L., 119 AD2d 209, 211, lv dismissed 70 NY2d 667).
Lastly, the joinder of William as a respondent will also serve the child’s interest in having her paternity decided swiftly and finally, for a decision rendered in a proceeding in which he is not a party cannot bind him, and leaves open the possibility of a later order declaring him to be the father (see, Matter of Tyrone G. v Fifi N., supra, at 14; cf., Matter of Cathleen P. v Gary P., 63 NY2d 805, 808, supra).
Since the matter must be remitted, we deem it advisable to note our agreement with respondent’s contention that, given the unique factual posture of this case and the serious consequences its resolution will have for the child, appointment of a Law Guardian to represent her interests would be judicious (see, Matter of Commissioner of Social Servs. of City of N. Y. [Betzaida D.] v Lazaro F., 99 Misc 2d 408, 409-410; cf., Matter of Leon L. v Carole H., 210 AD2d 484, 484-485; Johannessen v Johannessen, 148 AD2d 894, 895-896).
Mikoll, J. P., Mercure, Crew III and Casey, JJ., concur.
Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law and the facts, without costs, and matter remitted to the Family Court of Albany County for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court’s decision.
There is no indication that any scientific test was performed to determine whether William could be the child’s father.","Here is a concise holding based on the case document:

The appeals court held that the child's mother's husband should be joined as a party in the paternity proceeding, as he has parental rights and interests that could be affected. The court can then order him to submit to genetic testing. If he is excluded as the father, this would help rebut the presumption of legitimacy. A law guardian should also be appointed to represent the child's interests. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this holding.","In a case of disputed paternity, where a mother’s husband has been a substantial presence in the child’s life and desires to continue to exercise parental rights, the court may join the husband as a party in the case despite the presumption of legitimacy for a child born in a marriage."
"DONNELLY, Judge.
This is prohibition.
Believing that this case raises a question of general interest and importance, the Eastern District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, pursuant to Rule 83.02, ordered transfer of the case to this Court.
On October 21, 1976, relator secured a judgment against Oscar Wood in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County.
On September 9, 1979, pursuant to § 513.-380, RSMo 1978, and Rule 76.64 [now encompassed in Rule 76.27], the trial court ordered Wood to appear and be examined under oath as a judgment debtor. Section 513.380 provides:
“Whenever an execution against the property of any judgment debtor, individual or corporate, issued from any court in this state, shall be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, by any sheriff or other proper officer, the judgment creditor in such execution, his executor, administrator or assign, may, at any time within five years after such return so made, be entitled to an order by the court rendering such judgment, requiring the judgment debtor or, in the case of a corporate judgment debtor, its chief officer to appear before such court at a time and place in said order to be named, to undergo an examination under oath touching his ability and means to satisfy said judgment, and in case of neglect or refusal on the part of such judgment debtor or, in the case of a corporate debt- or, its chief officer to obey such order, such court is hereby authorized to issue a writ of attachment against said debtor, as now provided by law, and to punish him or, in the case of a corporate debtor, its chief officer for contempt.”
On October 10, 1979, Wood, accompanied by his attorney, appeared as ordered. Upon being interrogated by relator’s counsel, Wood answered the first question by giving his name, but thereafter refused to answer any other question. The judgment debtor’s refusal to answer was grounded upon the privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Missouri Constitution in Article I, § 19, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Upon relator’s objection that Wood’s refusal to answer was improper, the respondent judge overruled the objection and sustained the right of the witness not to answer the questions. Such was the action of the respondent toward the witness’ refusal to answer each of the first fifteen questions. Respondent then adjourned the proceeding until the next day at which time he stated that he believed his ruling the previous day was correct, but that Cantor v. Saitz, 562 S.W.2d 774 (Mo.App.1978), was the controlling authority and that missing from the record was a statement in general terms by the judgment debtor or his counsel of a “rational basis” upon which the answers to relator’s questions could conceivably incriminate him. Respondent then invited Wood’s counsel to make such a statement.
Wood’s counsel replied that, with respect to a question about where Wood lived and to a question which asked about two house addresses:
“[I]t’s conceivable that if the defendant [Wood] is living in a house with a person not his wife, a female not his wife, that would conceivably lead to the last link in a chain of causation on adultery or bigamy. So there are two conceivable possibilities there .... I think it’s clear that Mr. Wood was engaged in a real estate business with myriads of complicated documents most of which were signed under oath, or notarized. And to have him involved in any way in any aspect of his life at this time could conceivably tend to incriminate particularly with regard to properties he owned or lives in or has anything at all to do with .... In this case they specifically say that he has a design to defraud his creditors, and that’s what they’re trying to prove with this other examination. And that in itself is a misdemeanor.”
Thereafter, an additional twenty-two questions were asked, and to each Wood responded by claiming his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Relator then asked the respondent to ask the witness’ counsel to state the “rational basis” upon which the answers to the twenty-two questions might conceivably incriminate him. Respondent told relator that Wood’s counsel had already done so. Wood’s counsel stated further:
“[There are] criminal income tax implications both federal and state in addition to the other items mentioned.”
Respondent refused relator’s request that he ask Wood whether he was presently under any investigations.
It was then agreed that relator’s counsel would read into the record all of his remaining questions and at the conclusion thereof ask the witness generally whether he would answer any of them. This was done, the witness stating that he would answer none of the questions. Upon inquiry by relator’s counsel as to Wood’s reason for not answering, Wood stated:
“I refuse to testify under Article I, Section 19 of the Constitution of Missouri and under Article [sic] V of the Constitution of the United States on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.”
Stating that the witness’ counsel had stated in general terms a “rational basis” upon which Wood’s answers could conceivably incriminate him, and that there were no questions upon which it could be ruled that, as a matter of law, it would be impossible for the witness to incriminate himself, the respondent indicated that he intended to sustain Wood’s refusal to answer, but that he would withhold his ruling to permit the filing of a petition for a writ of prohibition.
Relator then filed such a petition in the Court of Appeals, Eastern District. On November 28, 1979, that court issued its preliminary writ ordering the examination of the judgment debtor stayed pending disposition of this case and prohibiting respondent from sustaining the witness’ refusal to answer each and every question put to him. The Court of Appeals then ordered this case transferred to this Court. We must dispose of the preliminary writ issued by the Court of Appeals.
The narrow question to be decided is whether the respondent will exceed his jurisdiction by sustaining the judgment debt- or’s refusal to answer the questions posed him at the § 513.380 examination. The answer to this question turns on the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination afforded the judgment debtor by the United States and, most importantly, Missouri Constitutions.
From the facts submitted by the parties, it is clear that the respondent believed the scope of the privilege afforded a judgment debtor in a § 513.380 examination was outlined in Cantor v. Saitz, supra.
In Cantor, after noting that the privilege against self-incrimination has been extended by the Missouri courts to judgment debtors in § 513.380 proceedings, the Court of Appeals surveyed the history of the privilege:
“The seminal case on the subject appears to have resulted from the historic trial of Aaron Burr in the early years of the 19th century. See United States v. Burr, 25 Fed.Cas. No. 14,692 E, pages 38, 40, 1 Burr’s Trial 244. Justice Marshall delineated some concrete guidelines for the scope of the privilege. Although Justice Marshall’s interpretation pertained to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, much of his language has been frequently quoted by our courts construing the scope of the constitutional privilege in Missouri. In Ex parte Gauss, 223 Mo. 277, 122 S.W. 741, 742, our supreme court adopted the following excerpt from Justice Marshall’s oft-cited opinion:
“ ‘[I]f the question be of such a description, that an answer to it may or may not criminate the witness, according to the purport of that answer, it must rest with himself, who alone can tell what it would be, to answer the question or not. If, in such a case, he say, upon his oath, that his answer would criminate himself, the court can demand no other testimony of the fact. * * * Many links frequently compose that chain of testimony which is necessary to convict any individual of a crime. It appears to the court to be the true sense of the rule, that no witness is compellable to furnish any one of them against himself. It is certainly not only a possible but a probable case, that a witness, by disclosing a single fact, may complete the testimony against himself, and to every effectual purpose accuse himself as entirely as he would by stating every circumstance which would be required for his conviction. The fact of itself might be unavailing; but, all other facts without it would be insufficient. While that remains concealed within his own bosom, he is safe; but draw it thence, and he is exposed to a prosecution. The rule which declares that no man is compella-ble to accuse himself, would most obviously be infringed, by compelling a witness to disclose a fact of this description. What testimony may be possessed, or is attainable, against any individual, the court can never know. It would seem, then, that the court ought never to compel a witness to give an answer which, discloses a fact that would form a necessary and essential part of a crime, which is punishable by the laws.’ State ex rel. Howard v. Allison, [431 S.W.2d 233, 237 (Mo.App.1968)]; State ex rel. Lee v. Cavanaugh, [419 S.W.2d 929, 933 (Mo.App.1967)]; Presta v. Owsley, 345 S.W.2d 649, 652 (Mo.App.1961); Ex Parte Arvin, 232 Mo.App. 796, 801, 112 S.W.2d 113, 116 [1937],
“In Gauss, supra, our supreme court went on to say that the principles set out in the Burr case, supra, are ‘ ... entirely consistent with the doctrine generally held, [and specifically followed in Missouri cases] that where the court can say, as a matter of law, that it is impossible that a witness would incriminate himself by answering a question one way or the other, then the court can require an answer .... ’ Ex parte Gauss, 223 Mo. [at] 285, 122 S.W. at 742 [1909]; State ex rel. Howard v. Allison, supra, [431 S.W.2d] at 237; State ex rel. Lee v. Cavanaugh, supra, [419 S.W.2d] at 933; Presta v. Owsley, supra, [345 S.W.2d] at 652; Ex parte Arvin, 232 Mo.App. [at] 802-03; 112 S.W.2d at 116, 117. Perhaps the consistency is best illustrated in State ex rel. Caloia v. Weinstein, [525 S.W.2d 779, 780, 781 (Mo.App.1975)]:
“ ‘ ... [T]he witness knows what the court cannot know and the witness must himself judge what the effect of his answer will be. So, if he says under oath that he cannot answer without incriminating himself, then the case is not one where the court can say as a matter of law that it would be impossible for him to incriminate himself by answering the question one way or another. He cannot be compelled to answer and will be protected by law in his refusal to do. State ex rel. Howard v. Allison, 431 S.W.2d 233, 236[5], 237[6] (Mo.App.1968); Presta v. Owsley, 345 S.W.2d 649, 652[1] (Mo.App.1961); Brady v. Brady, 71 S.W.2d 42, 46[3, 4] (Mo.App.1934).’ ”
Cantor, supra, 562 S.W.2d at 777-78.
The Court of Appeals, in Cantor, then noted that several Missouri cases, including Presta v. Owsley, supra, appeared to conflict with Gauss and Chief Justice Marshall’s discussion of the privilege in Burr, by imposing a “burden of proof” on the witness claiming the privilege to show that an answer to the question asked might tend to incriminate him. The Cantor court, quite correctly we believe, noted:
“This burden requires an explanation from the witness, and puts the judge in a position to evaluate the witness’ claim. The court in Presta, went on to say that if a particular question appears innocuous on its face, the witness has the burden of showing that the answer might incriminate him. In State ex rel. Lee v. Cavanaugh, supra, [419 S.W.2d] at 934, however, the court pointed out that ‘ .. . the privilege extends not only to refusing to answer the question asked, but to refusing to explain how the answer might incriminate the witness.’ The obvious danger of the Presta approach is the explanation may be as incriminating as the answer sought. The danger of self-incrimination becomes ever more present with each word of the explanation, and the protection guaranteed is thereby undermined.”
Cantor, supra, 562 S.W.2d at 778.
Declaring it wrong to place a “burden of proof” upon the witness, the Cantor court nevertheless recognized that “the privilege is, absent some check, subject to abuse by anyone wanting to evade responding to a question.” Id. The “check” the Court of Appeals in Cantor believed proper was “requiring the witness or his counsel to describe, in general terms, a rational basis upon which his answer could conceivably incriminate him.” Id. Although the Court of Appeals cautioned trial judges, in making a determination whether they could say as a matter of law that it would be impossible for a witness to incriminate himself, to be “acutely aware that in the deviousness of crime and its detection incrimination may be approached and achieved by obscure and unlikely lines of inquiry,” we do not believe the “rational basis” approach provides greater protection against compelling a witness to incriminate himself than the criticized “burden of proof” test. It would appear that many, if not all, of the dangers the Cantor court saw in placing a “burden of proof” on the witness to show that his answer might tend to incriminate him, are still present when the witness is required to state a “rational basis” upon which his answer could conceivably incriminate him. By requiring the witness to state a “rational basis,” it is possible that the witness will “surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee.” Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). “Logically, indeed, he is boxed in a paradox, for he must prove the crimi-natory character of what it is his privilege to suppress just because it is criminatory. The only practicable solution is to be content with the door’s being set a little ajar, and while at times it permits the suppression of competent evidence, nothing better is available.” United States v. Weisman, 111 F.2d 260, 262 (2d Cir. 1940). Both the “burden of proof” requirement and the less stringent “rational basis” requirement involve an element of compulsion which we find inconsistent with the principles underlying the privilege.
We may neither “add to nor subtract from the mandates of the United States Constitution,” North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 376, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1759, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). However, in order to assure that the protection given by Article I, § 19, of the Missouri Constitution, is meaningful, we hold that once a witness claims the privilege afforded him under that provision, a rebuttable presumption arises that the witness’ answer might tend to incriminate him, a presumption that can be rebutted by a demonstration by the party seeking the answer that such answer “ ‘cannot possibly’ have such tendency to incriminate.” Temple v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 892, 898 (1881), cited with approval in Hoffman v. United States, supra, 341 U.S. at 488-89, 71 S.Ct. at 819. We believe this rule to be consistent with the principle, early expressed by Chief Justice Marshall in Burr, supra, that “it belongs to the court to consider and to decide whether any direct answer [to a question propounded] can implicate the witness,” for it will fall upon the court to decide whether the presumption has been rebutted and, therefore, whether the witness must answer the question.
Since the respondent applied the Cantor standard, we make the preliminary writ of prohibition issued by the Court of Appeals absolute, and prohibit respondent from proceeding further in a manner inconsistent with the standard enunciated in this opinion.
All concur.","The holding in this case is: 

A witness who claims privilege against self-incrimination under the Missouri Constitution is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that their answer could tend to incriminate them. This presumption can be rebutted by the party seeking the answer demonstrating that the answer cannot possibly have such a tendency. Once the privilege is claimed, the court must decide whether the presumption has been rebutted and if the witness must answer.","When assessing the privilege against self-incrimination, rather than requiring the witness to describe a rational basis for the incriminating nature of the testimony, the court should apply a rebuttable presumption that the testimony would be incriminating."
"Opinion of the Court by
Justice CUNNINGHAM.
Appellee B.J., a minor, was adjudicated a habitual truant by the Jefferson Family Court. The Court of Appeals vacated the order and remanded the matter, determining that the family court had violated B.J.’s constitutional rights by conducting both the adjudication and sentencing hearings in his absence. The Commonwealth sought discretionary review in this Court, which was granted. Upon review of the matter, we reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the Jefferson Family Court.
Jefferson County school officials initiated a petition against B.J. in family court alleging that he was a habitual truant. At an initial appearance on the matter, B.J. entered a plea of not guilty. However, neither B.J. nor his custodial parent, his mother, appeared at the subsequent adjudication hearing. B.J.’s attorney explained to the court that B.J.’s mother had informed her that he simply refused to attend the hearing.
B.J.’s counsel objected to any further action in the proceeding. Relying on RCr 8.28(1) and (4), counsel argued that the rule did not explicitly except juvenile proceedings from the requirement that the defendant be present at trial. The family court overruled the objection and proceeded with the adjudication hearing, concluding that B.J. had notice of the hearing and that the criminal rules did not apply to a status offense proceeding. The family court then heard testimony and ultimately adjudicated B.J. a habitual truant, ordering him to attend school. A disposition hearing was held approximately two months later. Again, B.J. was not present, though his mother and counsel appeared. B.J.’s attorney renewed her objection to any further action in the case in B.J.’s absence. That motion was again overruled, and B.J. was then probated to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. B.J. sought review by the Court of Appeals, which vacated and remanded the family court’s adjudication and disposition orders.
On appeal, B.J. argues that his due process rights were violated when the Jefferson Family Court conducted his adjudication and disposition hearings in his absence. Furthermore, B.J. contends that the court’s action was in violation of RCr 8.28. It should be noted that B.J.’s counsel, in arguing that the family court was acting in violation of RCr 8.28, effectively invoked the application of the criminal rules to this juvenile proceeding. KRS 610.080(2).
As set forth in Section 11 of the Kentucky Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to be present at every critical stage of the proceedings against him. See Price v. Commonwealth, 31 S.W.3d 885, 892 (Ky.2000). The right to be present is further governed by RCr 8.28, which generally provides that the defendant shall be present at every critical stage of the proceedings.
However, the rule does not require the defendant’s presence at every stage of the proceedings. By its own terms, the rule states that the defendant’s presence is not required “in prosecutions for misdemeanors or violations.” Rather, the rule permits arraignment, plea, trial and sentencing in the defendant’s absence. RCr 8.28(4). Moreover, even in the case of a felony prosecution, the rule permits the trial to continue where the defendant’s absence is voluntary after the trial begins. RCr 8.28(1). Subsection 1 of the rule is therefore in line with this Court’s recognition that a defendant may validly waive his right to be present at the proceedings against him. Fugate v. Commonwealth, 62 S.W.3d 15, 19 (Ky.2001). See also McKinney v. Commonwealth, 474 S.W.2d 384 (Ky.1971) (finding no due process violation where defendant was tried in absentia, as defendant voluntarily remained absent from the trial). The issue in this case, then, is whether B.J.’s due process rights were violated when the family court conducted his adjudication and disposition hearings in his absence.
B.J. was brought to the family court on allegations that he was a habitual truant, which is a status offense. KRS 600.020(58); KRS 630.020(3). By its very definition, status offenses are neither criminal nor delinquent. KRS 600.020(58). However, this is not to diminish the import of the proceedings. “A proceeding against a child for the status offense of habitual truancy under Chapter 630 ... can result in severe consequences to that child.” T.D. v. Commonwealth, 165 S.W.3d 480, 483 (Ky.App.2005).
In light of these potentially severe consequences to the child, due process must be afforded, despite the non-criminal nature of juvenile proceedings. “[Wjhere the fault of the child is at issue and penalties, including loss of liberty, may attach, criminal protections provided by the constitution apply.” Id. A juvenile enjoys all the rights afforded by the Bill of Rights. Application of Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).
Nonetheless, not every specific constitutional guarantee afforded to adult offenders applies in juvenile proceedings. Rather, the protective purpose of juvenile proceedings sometimes requires that formal constitutional safeguards be dispensed with, so long as the purpose of juvenile proceedings remains rehabilitative and not punitive. For example, a trial by jury in the adjudicatory stage of a juvenile proceeding is not required by the Constitution, as such would thwart the confidential and non-adversarial nature of the juvenile court. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 547, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 1987, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971). Rather, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that “the applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings ... is fundamental fairness.” McKeiver, 403 U.S. at 543, 91 S.Ct. at 1985.
Thus, we examine whether it was fundamentally unfair to conduct B.J.’s adjudication and disposition hearings in his absence. Of course, B.J. had a constitutional right to attend the hearings. Commonwealth v. M.G., 75 S.W.3d 714 (Ky.App.2002). However, may a juvenile validly waive this right?
The U.S. Supreme Court has not squarely addressed this issue, though it has recognized a juvenile’s capacity to waive important constitutional protections and rights. When made knowingly and voluntarily, a juvenile may waive his right to counsel. Application of Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). A juvenile may waive his right to remain silent and his right to have counsel present during an interrogation. Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979). A juvenile may waive his right to a trial by jury. U.S. v. King, 482 F.2d 454 (6th Cir.1973) cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1076, 94 S.Ct. 594, 38 L.Ed.2d 483 (1973).
Furthermore, we note other states that recognize the juvenile’s right to waive presence at important proceedings. See State v. Muhammad, 237 Kan. 850, 703 P.2d 835 (Kan.1985)(no due process violation where juvenile was absent at proceeding where juvenile jurisdiction was waived and matter transferred to adult court); J.R. v. State, 953 So.2d 690, 691 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (juvenile may waive right to be present at arraignment); In Re Mabelin F., 28 A.D.3d 384, 813 N.Y.S.2d 427 (N.Y.App.Div.2006) (no due process violation where juvenile waived right to be present during medical testimony concerning death of her newborn child). In fact, the Kentucky Court of Appeals seems to have recognized the capacity of a juvenile to waive his or her right to be present at a critical stage of the proceedings. In Commonwealth v. M.G., the court excluded two juvenile offenders from the courtroom during the testimony of their alleged victim. In finding a violation of the juveniles’ due process rights, the Court of Appeals noted that there was not “any suggestion that the juveniles themselves expressed a conscious intent to relinquish their right to be present when the Commonwealth’s principal witness testified.” M.G., 75 S.W.3d at 721.
In light of the other constitutional rights that a juvenile may waive, we find no reason that a juvenile should not be permitted to waive his right to be present at a critical stage of the proceedings. Where a juvenile makes such a waiver knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently, the “basic requirements of due process and fairness” required of juvenile proceedings are satisfied. Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 553, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 1053, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966).
Here, the trial court heard lengthy arguments from counsel concerning Appellant’s failure to appear at the hearings, and whether his absence prohibited further proceedings. “[A]lthough the [Commonwealth has the burden of proving that a defendant’s absence from trial was intentional, knowing, and voluntary, it may be inferred that a defendant’s absence met this standard where it is shown that such defendant had knowledge of the trial date and failed to appear.” Donta v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 719, 722 (Ky.App.1993) (upholding trial court’s conclusion that defendant validly waived his right to appear at his trial for a misdemeanor offense). At his arraignment, B.J. was informed of his future court dates. Likewise, B.J.’s mother made representations to counsel that B.J. was aware of the hearing and chose not to attend. In determining that the child willingly avoided his court date, the family court surely took into consideration the fact that B.J. had not attended school one single day as of the November 2nd adjudication hearing. See McKinney, 474 S.W.2d at 387 (in determining whether an absence was voluntary, “it is proper to tailor the requirements as to proof to the realities of the situation”). No evidence was presented that B.J.’s absence was involuntary. While the trial court could have been more specific in its findings — a practice we encourage — it is clear from the record that the trial court considered counsels’ arguments concerning waiver, and concluded that Appellant had waived his right to be present at the hearings. Under the circumstances as presented to the family court, it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that B.J. validly waived his right to appear at both his adjudication and disposition hearings.
The opinion of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Jefferson Family Court is hereby reinstated.
LAMBERT, C.J.; ABRAMSON, NOBLE, SCHRODER, and SCOTT, JJ., concur.
MINTON, J., dissents by separate opinion.","This case involves whether a juvenile's due process rights are violated when adjudication and disposition hearings are conducted in the juvenile's absence. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that a juvenile can validly waive the right to be present at critical stages of juvenile proceedings. The Court found that the family court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the juvenile, B.J., voluntarily waived his right to appear at the adjudication and disposition hearings by refusing to attend despite having notice of the hearings. Thus, conducting the hearings in B.J.'s absence did not violate his due process rights.","When a juvenile misses their court hearings despite having adequate notice and all other evidence suggests the absence is voluntarily, a court does not abuse its discretion by concluding that the juvenile has waived their right to appear."
"OPINION
Per Curiam:
In this appeal, the court is asked to consider the effect of three statutes and whether the district court properly applied these statutes in awarding respondent $7,673.50 in attorney’s fees and $5,240.00 in costs at the conclusion of the trial. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court.
THE FACTS
On September 22, 1986, the appellant, Lisa Bowyer, and her sister, Theresa Taack, were involved in an automobile accident. As a result of the accident, Lisa filed a complaint with the district court naming Theresa as the defendant.
Prior to trial, Theresa served Lisa with an offer of judgment in the amount of $17,001.00. The offer was rejected and trial was scheduled for April 30, 1990. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict awarding Lisa $10,500.00 for her damages.
Lisa’s counsel then filed motions requesting $12,236.54 in costs, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest. Theresa objected to this request and filed her own motion requesting $12,913.50 for costs and attorney’s fees. After hearing the litigants’ arguments, the district court concluded that Lisa’s judgment was less than the offer of judgment tendered by Theresa and ordered Lisa to pay Theresa’s costs and attorney’s fees. This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
In her appeal, Lisa argues the district court erred when it awarded costs and attorney’s fees to Theresa. Specifically, Lisa asserts: (1) that she is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to NRS 18.010 regardless of whether the judgment she received was less than the offer of judgment tendered by Theresa; (2) that Theresa’s offer of judgment is void in any event because it was made pursuant to both NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115; and (3) that even if Theresa’s offer of judgment is not void, in deciding whether or not a party has obtained a more favorable judgment than an offer of judgment, the court should include costs, prejudgment interest, and attorney’s fees as part of the judgment.
A.
“[T]he court may make an allowance of attorney’s fees to a prevailing party . . . [w]hen he has not recovered more than $20,000 . . . NRS 18.010(2). Lisa argues she was the prevailing party because she received $10,500.00 in damages from the jury. Therefore, Lisa reasons that since she recovered less than $20,000.00, the district court should have granted her request for attorney’s fees, regardless of whether her judgment exceeded the offer of judgment tendered by Theresa prior to trial. We disagree.
Lisa’s position on this issue contravenes the provisions of NRS 17.115 and NRCP 68. NRS 17.115(4) states that “[i]f the party to whom [an] offer of judgment is made fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, he cannot recover . . . [cjosts or attorney ’5 fees . . . .” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, NRCP 68 provides that “[i]f the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer [of judgment], the offeree shall not recover costs, nor attorneys’ fees . . . .” (Emphasis added.)
If possible, it is the Nevada Supreme Court’s obligation to construe statutory provisions in such a manner as to render them compatible. Weston v. County of Lincoln, 98 Nev. 183, 185, 643 P.2d 1227, 1229 (1982). Therefore, we conclude that where litigants are precluded from obtaining attorney’s fees under NRS 17.115 or NRCP 68, they are likewise precluded from recovering such fees under NRS 18.010.
B.
Next, Lisa points out that Theresa’s offer of judgment was tendered pursuant to NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115. The provisions of NRCP 68 do not specifically address prejudgment interest; however, under NRS 17.115, a litigant is precluded from recovering any prejudgment interest that accrues from the filing date of the complaint through trial if the litigant does not obtain a judgment greater than a previously tendered offer of judgment. See NRS 17.115(4). The different treatment of prejudgment interest under NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115 underscores Lisa’s contention that she was unable to ascertain whether she was risking her prejudgment interest by rejecting Theresa’s offer of judgment. Therefore, Lisa asks this court to rule that whenever an offer of judgment is made pursuant to both NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115, the offer is ambiguous and void. We reject this attempt to polarize the rule of procedure and the statute.
Contrary to Lisa’s analysis, apparent conflicts between a court rule and a statutory provision should be harmonized and both should be given effect if possible. State v. Ryan, 691 P.2d 197, 206 (Wash. 1984). Since NRCP 68 is silent with respect to prejudgment interest, it should be interpreted harmoniously with the more specific provisions and legislative policy of NRS 17.115; thus, if individuals fail to secure a judgment greater than a previously tendered offer of judgment, they cannot seek an award of prejudgment interest under either NRCP 68 or NRS 17.115.
C.
Finally, Lisa fires another volley and asserts that she obtained a judgment greater than the offer of judgment tendered by Theresa. In a rather circular analysis, Lisa contends her damage award, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees are all part of her judgment. Therefore, Lisa reasons that her judgment totals more than Theresa’s offer of judgment. We disagree.
1. The provisions of NRS 17.115(5). The provisions of NRS 17.115(5) outline what can be included in a judgment when deciding whether the judgment is more favorable than an offer of judgment. The provisions of NRS 17.115(5) state that “[a]ny taxable costs, attorney’s fees and interest which is not derived from an interest-bearing obligation which may have been awarded must not be considered to be part of the judgment when determining whether the judgment was more favorable than the rejected offer.'"" (Emphasis added.) Therefore, Lisa is clearly incorrect when she argues that, pursuant to NRS 17.115, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees should be included in her judgment to determine whether her judgment is more favorable than Theresa’s offer of judgment.
2. The provisions of NRCP 68. Unfortunately, NRCP 68 is not as specific as NRS 17.115(5). NRCP 68 merely states that “[i]f the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree shall not recover costs, nor attorneys’ fees, but shall pay the costs and attorneys’ fees, if any be allowed, of the party making the offer from the time of the offer.” This disparity between NRS 17.115(5) and NRCP 68 is complicated by federal court interpretations of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, a statute similar to NRCP 68. See, e.g., Gorelangton v. City of Reno, 638 F.Supp. 1426 (D.Nev. 1986).
3. Reconciling NRS 17.115 and NRCP 68. Since Theresa’s offer of judgment was made pursuant to NRS 17.115 and NRCP 68, Lisa argues NRS 17.115(5) should be ignored, and pursuant to NRCP 68, her judgment should include prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees. Lisa argues this conclusion is warranted because of federal court interpretations of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 and because an offeree needs to be able to make an informed decision regarding the consequences of accepting or rejecting an offer of judgment made pursuant to NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115. We reject this analysis.
First, this court can construe the provisions of NRCP 68 as it deems appropriate. Federal court interpretations of Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are persuasive but not controlling here. See Johnson By Johnson v. Svidergol, 757 P.2d 609, 611 (Ariz.Ct.App. 1988).
Further, we believe this court should avoid construing one of its rules of procedure and a statute in a manner which creates a conflict or inconsistency between them. See United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Co., 560 P.2d 161, 164 (N.M. 1976). “A fundamental rule of statutory interpretation [footnote omitted] is that the unreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another that would produce a reasonable result.” Sheriff v. Smith, 91 Nev. 729, 733, 542 P.2d 440, 443 (1975). See also Hughes Properties v. State of Nevada, 100 Nev. 295, 298, 680 P.2d 970, 971 (1984). If this court were to interpret NRCP 68 such that this rule of procedure dramatically conflicts with NRS 17.115, the rule of procedure would be rendered ineffectual and meaningless: defendants would merely disregard NRCP 68 and tender all offers of judgment pursuant to NRS 17.115.
Therefore, we conclude that the best way to resolve this issue is to construe NRCP 68 in a manner that is consistent with the specific language and the legislative policy indicated in NRS 17.115(5). We hold that under either NRCP 68 or NRS 17.115, taxable costs, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest should not be included as part of a judgment to determine whether the judgment is greater than a previously tendered offer of judgment. The judgment entered by the district court is affirmed.
Lisa asserts that prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees should accrue from the date the complaint is filed to the entry of judgment. If the court were to accept her analysis, Lisa’s judgment would include the $10,500.00 damage award plus $2,406.25 for prejudgment interest plus costs of $4,668.79 plus attorney’s fees of $5,162.50. Therefore, Lisa’s judgment would equal $22,737.54. Ironically, under Lisa’s analysis, however, she would not be entitled to attorney’s fees because her judgment, including attorney’s fees, would exceed the $20,000 statutory ceiling for attorney’s fees under NRS 18.010(2).","This opinion indicates the Nevada Supreme Court holds that when determining whether a judgment is more favorable than an offer of judgment under NRCP 68 or NRS 17.115, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney's fees should not be included as part of the judgment amount. The court ruled this way to harmonize NRCP 68 and NRS 17.115 and avoid conflicts between the rule and statute.","Plaintiff's judgement of $10,500 does not include taxable costs, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest and therefore is not greater than the previously tendered offer of $17,001."
"DICKINSON, Justice,
for the Court.
¶ 1. A municipal court judge involved himself in ticket fixing by “passing” fourteen traffic tickets to the file over the objections of the issuing officer. The Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance (“Commission”) filed a formal complaint against the judge alleging willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute. The Commission and judge submitted to this Court a joint motion for approval of the recommendation of a public reprimand and assessment of costs. In accordance with our constitutional mandate, we conduct the following review.
FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION
¶ 2. On or about July 20, 2005, Benton Rex Gordon, Jr., Municipal Court Judge, Union, Mississippi, approached Officer Melody E. McNall prior to the afternoon court session to discuss a number of speeding tickets issued by the officer. Judge Gordon explained that several upset Union residents had contacted him, the police chief, and the clerks of the court about the citations. Judge Gordon informed Officer McNall that he intended to “pass” all of the citations to the files and issue warning letters to the defendants instead. Although Officer McNall expressed her disagreement with this course of action, the defendants were advised not to appear in court because their tickets had already been “passed” to the files. In total, Judge Gordon “passed” tickets for fourteen defendants without requiring them to appear in court.
¶ 3. Acting on Officer McNall’s complaint, the Commission filed a formal complaint against Judge Gordon charging him with “willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute” in violation of Canons l, 2 A, 2 B, 3 A, 3 B(2), 3 B(7), and 3 C(l) of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct and Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, as amended. The parties reached an agreement on the charges pri- or to Judge Gordon filing a response, and they have submitted to this Court a joint motion for approval of the Commission’s recommendation of a public reprimand and assessment of costs.
DISCUSSION
¶ 4. “This Court conducts de novo review of judicial misconduct proceedings, giving great deference to the findings, based on clear and convincing evidence, of the recommendations of the [Commission].” Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Gunn, 614 So.2d 387, 389 (Miss.1993). However, because we “have the sole power to impose sanctions in judicial misconduct cases,” we are obligated to render an independent judgment on the charges. Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Gibson, 883 So.2d 1155, 1157 (Miss.2004) (citing Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Peyton, 645 So.2d 954, 956 (Miss.1994)). Even though the Commission’s findings are considered and are given great weight, this Court is not bound by the findings, and additional sanctions may be imposed. Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Whitten, 687 So.2d 744, 746 (Miss.1997).
I. Whether Judge Gordon’s conduct constituted willful misconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute.
¶ 5. Our initial task is to determine whether the Commission appropriately charged Judge Gordon with willful misconduct, which we have defined as follows:
‘Willful misconduct in office is the improper or wrongful use of the power of his [or her] office by a judge acting intentionally, or with gross unconcern for his conduct, and generally in bad faith. It involves more than an error of judgment or a mere lack of diligence. Necessarily, the term would encompass conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption, and also any knowing misuse of the office, whatever the motive. However, these elements are not necessary to a finding of bad faith. A specific intent to use the powers of the judicial office to accomplish a purpose which the judge knew or should have known was beyond the legitimate exercise of his [or her] authority constitutes bad faith....
‘Willful misconduct in office of necessity is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. However, a judge may also, through negligence or ignorance not amounting to bad faith, behave in a manner prejudicial to the administration of justice so as to bring the judicial office into disrepute.’
In re Anderson, 412 So.2d 743, 745 (Miss.1982) (quoting In re Nowell, 293 N.C. 235, 248-49, 237 S.E.2d 246, 255 (1977) (emphasis in original)).
¶ 6. Judge Gordon used his position as Municipal Court Judge to fix tickets by “passing” them to the file without requiring the defendants to appear in court and over the objections of the issuing officer. He also engaged in ex parte conversations with defendants. The Commission determined by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Gordon’s actions violated Canons 1, 2 A, 2 B, 3 A, 3 B(2), 3 B(7), and 3 C(l) of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct and Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, as amended. We can find no error in the Commission’s determination.
¶ 7. Whether Judge Gordon’s behavior was actually willful is of no consequence. Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Cowart, 936 So.2d 343, 347 (Miss.2006). “The result is the same regardless of whether bad faith or negligence and ignorance are involved and warrants sanctions.” In re Anderson, 451 So.2d 232, 234 (Miss.1984).
¶ 8. This Court historically has taken a firm stance on the practice of ticket fixing. Gunn, 614 So.2d at 389 (citing In re Hearn, 542 So.2d 901, 902-03 (Miss.1989) (judge removed from office for continuing to fix tickets)). We have, without exception, found such behavior to constitute misconduct. See, e.g., Cowart, 936 So.2d at 347 (willful misconduct for judge to contact an officer and dispose of traffic violations without hearings or notice to the issuing officer); Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Williams, 880 So.2d 343, 346 (Miss.2004) (willful misconduct for judge to find four defendants “not guilty” of speeding violations before defendants appeared in court or had their cases set for trial); Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Boykin, 763 So.2d 872, 874 (Miss.2000) (willful misconduct for judge to dismiss tickets based on ex parte communications with the defendants without holding hearings or notifying the issuing officers); Gunn, 614 So.2d at 389 (willful misconduct for judge to dismiss traffic tickets without holding hearings or notifying the issuing officers).
¶ 9. Likewise, this Court has repeatedly characterized a judge’s participation in ex parte communications as willful misconduct. See, e.g., Cowart, 936 So.2d at 347 (ex parte communication with plaintiff in a domestic violence case was willful misconduct); Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Blakeney, 848 So.2d 824, 826 (Miss.2003) (ex parte communication with police officer in DUI and drug possession case was willful misconduct); Boykin, 763 So.2d at 874 (ex parte communications with multiple defendants in traffic violation cases was willful misconduct); Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Vess, 692 So.2d 80, 84 (Miss.1997) (ex parte communications with criminal defendant, arresting officer, and prosecutor was willful misconduct).
¶ 10. In accordance with this precedent, we find that Judge Gordon’s conduct constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute. Accordingly, we adopt the Commission’s findings.
II. Whether Judge Gordon should be publicly reprimanded and assessed all costs as recommended by the Commission.
¶ 11. The Commission has recommended that Judge Gordon be publicly reprimanded and assessed all costs associated with this proceeding in the amount of $100. The Commission and Judge Gordon have signed an Agreed Statement of Facts and Proposed Recommendation to this effect, and the agreement was unanimously accepted and adopted by the Commission. However, “[i]mposing sanctions is left solely to the discretion of this Court,” and we endeavor to match the sanction with the offense at issue. Cowart, 936 So.2d at 347.
¶ 12. Pursuant to this Court’s holding in Gibson, 883 So.2d at 1158, this Court must review the following mitigating factors when determining the appropriateness of a recommended sanction:
(1) The length and character of the judge’s public service.
¶ 13. The violations at issue occurred during Judge Gordon’s twelfth year as a municipal court judge. The record is silent as to the character of his service.
(¾) Whether there is any prior case law on point.
¶ 14. A great deal of judicial precedent exists on these issues. See case law cited infra.
(3) The magnitude of the offense and the harm suffered.
¶ 15. Judge Gordon’s willful misconduct violated Canons 1, 2 A, 2 B, 3 A, 3 B(2), 3 B(7), and 3 C(l) of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct and Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, as amended. The violation of multiple Canons and the Mississippi Constitution itself reflects the seriousness of the misconduct.
¶ 16. The harm caused by Judge Gordon’s behavior extended beyond injuries to the integrity of his judicial office. His conduct compromised in multiple ways the integrity of Officer McNall, as well as our system of justice. For instance, Judge Gordon’s actions gave the impermissible (but apparently correct) impression to some Union residents that they had sufficient influence over him to deny the prosecution a fair opportunity to present its case against the defendants at trial. Finally, as stated by the Commission, “the residents of Union, Mississippi, were deprived of the municipality’s legitimate interest in punishing drivers who violate the [city’s speed limits].”
(Jp) Whether the misconduct is an isolated incident or evidences a pattern of conduct.
¶ 17. The only prior disciplinary matter involving Judge Gordon is an unrelated, informal Commission action in 1994. Therefore, the record does not demonstrate that Judge Gordon’s actions evidence a pattern of misconduct.
¶ 18. Judge Gordon improperly “passed” fourteen tickets to the file for fourteen different defendants without requiring any of them to appear in court. This action was taken despite the clearly voiced objection of the issuing officer. However, these violations were relatively close in time and were collectively the subject of one disciplinary action against Judge Gordon.
(5) Whether moral turpitude was involved.
¶ 19. In Gibson, this Court defined moral turpitude to include “actions which involve interference with the administration of justice, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, or other such actions which bring the judiciary into disrepute.” 883 So.2d at 1158 n. 2. The Commission argues that “[t]he act of ‘ticket fixing’ interferes with the administration of justice by interfering with the judicial process,” and therefore, Gordon’s conduct involves moral turpitude. See Cowart, 936 So.2d at 350.
¶ 20. The bottom line of this element is that we must determine whether a judge’s conduct crosses the line from simple negligence or mistake, to willful conduct which takes advantage of a judge’s position for greed or other inappropriate motives. If the conduct willfully subverts justice, more punishment is warranted. In this instance, we hold that “fixing tickets” willfully subverts justice; therefore, Judge Gordon has crossed the line of moral turpitude.
(6) The presence or absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.
¶ 21. Although there is little in the record before us concerning mitigating or aggravating circumstances, we find it quite significant that Judge Gordon readily acknowledged his inappropriate conduct and took responsibility for his actions.
¶ 22. The above Gibson factors, when considered together under our standard of review, lead us to the conclusion that the Commission’s recommendation is insufficient considering the egregious nature of Judge Gordon’s conduct. We therefore find that the Commission’s recommendation should be enhanced to provide for a thirty-day suspension.
¶ 23. In several prior judicial misconduct cases involving ex parte communications in conjunction with improper ticket fixing, this Court has found a public reprimand and assessment of costs to be appropriate. See Williams, 880 So.2d at 347 (“Often the sanction for ‘fixing’ tickets is a public reprimand, fine, and assessment of costs.”); Miss. Comm’n on Judicial Performance v. Warren, 791 So.2d 194, 196 (Miss.2001) (imposing a public reprimand, a $765 fine, and $100 in court costs for “fixing” tickets based on ex parte communications); Gunn, 614 So.2d at 388 (adopting Commission’s recommendations for public reprimand and a $400 fine for a judge who “fixed” eight traffic tickets by writing on the ticket or docket book that the charges were dismissed).
¶ 24. In the instant case, Judge Gordon involved himself in ticket fixing by “passing” fourteen tickets to the file without requiring the defendants to appear in court and over the specific objections of the issuing officer. This misconduct was precipitated by Judge Gordon’s ex parte communications with some of the defendants. It is true that, in the past, this Court has not always required a suspension for similar conduct. However, since Miss. Comm’n On Judicial Performance v. Sanford, this Court has made it very clear that conduct akin to Judge Gordon’s warrants a more severe penalty, including a suspension. 941 So.2d 209 (Miss.2006). In Sanford, we recognized the need for consistency in imposing sanctions but held that where egregious conduct is apparent, the appropriate sanction is not only a reprimand, but also a suspension. Accordingly, Judge Gordon’s conduct was egregious, and we find that the Commission’s recommendation should be enhanced to provide for a thirty-day suspension.
CONCLUSION
¶ 25. For the reasons herein, we find the egregious conduct of Benton Rex Gordon, Jr., Municipal Court Judge, Union, Mississippi, constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute pursuant to Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, as amended. The Joint Motion for Approval of Recommendations filed by the Commission and Judge Gordon is granted, and accordingly, Judge Gordon is to be publicly reprimanded, suspended for thirty days and assessed $100 in court costs.
¶ 26. JUDGE BENTON REX GORDON, JR., MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE, SHALL BE PUBLICLY REPRIMANDED IN OPEN COURT BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE NEWTON COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM OF THAT COURT AFTER THIS DECISION BECOMES FINAL; IS SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY FOR THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM AND AFTER THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE MANDATE IN THIS CASE AND ASSESSED COURT COSTS OF $100.00.

"Braucher, J.
The insurer under a combination motor vehicle policy seeks a declaration that it is entitled to disclaim liability, after an accident, on the ground of intentional misrepresentation of ownership by the named insured. The true owner was not the named insured but his twenty-year old son, who lived with his parents. We hold that there was no evidence that the misrepresentation was material and that the insurer lost any right to disclaim by its delay in asserting the right after discovering the facts. We therefore reverse the decree obtained by the insurer and direct the entry of a decree for the insureds.
We summarize first the judge’s findings as to matters not in dispute. The son bought a car on or about January 21, 1966, and had it registered and insured in his father’s name through the insurer’s agent in Pittsfield. The insurance policy provided coverage for “Bodily Injury Liability — Statutory,” commonly called “compulsory coverage,” in the amount of $5,000 for each person and $10,000 for each accident. It also provided what is commonly known as “guest coverage” in like amounts, “Increased Limits” to the amount of $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident, “Auto Medical Payments” of $500 for each person, and “Property Damage Liability” of $5,000 for each accident. It was written on the basis that the principal operator of the car was to be a male under twenty-five years ofage.
Soon the son became dissatisfied with the car, returned it, and received a refund. Thereafter, on February 26,1966, he went to a car dealer and decided to purchase a second car at an agreed price of $1,500. The salesman told him he would have to have someone over twenty-one years of age buy the car for him, and he brought in his cousin, had the bill of sale made out to the cousin, paid $1,500 in cash, and drove the car home with dealer’s registration plates. He went to the insurer’s agent and asked that the insurance and registration plates be transferred to the second car. An indorsement to the policy changing the car was issued February 28, 1966, and on or before that date the father executed as owner an application for registration of the second car. Also on February 28, 1966, a policy providing collision coverage on the second car was issued in the name of the father as owner. About $500 of the funds for the second car came from the son’s funds; about $1,000 came from a licensed loan company on a loan to the son as applicant and maker of a note, with the father as comaker.
On December 2, 1966, the second car, with the son driving, was involved in a collision with several other cars, including one owned and operated by Miss Nigrelli, who was allowed to intervene in the present case. The son duly reported the accident to the insurer, and on January 5, 1967, he gave the insurer’s investigator a full statement in writing, including the facts as to his purchase of the car. At the investigator’s suggestion the son obtained from his cousin a writing, dated January 16, 1967, transferring ownership of the car to the father, and sent the paper to the insurer. The insurer then paid the father the loss under the collision policy and part of that payment was used by the son to pay the balance due on the loan.
Miss Nigrelli began an action in tort for negligence against the father and the son. The defendants in the action were served on March 19,1967, and the action was entered in the Superior Court on May 1,1967. The plaintiff in that action filed interrogatories on May 1,1967, and the defendants signed answers about June 3, 1967. The next step in the action was reference to a conciliator and to an auditor on June 20, 1968. On July 3, 1968, the orders of reference were vacated by the allowance of a motion signed by counsel for the insurer and assented to by counsel for Miss Nigrelli, reciting that “there is a serious question as to the coverage afforded the defendant by the defendant’s insurance company.” The present suit was filed on July 30,1968.
The judge also found that the father, when he signed the application for registration of the second car, knew that it was being registered in his name as owner and that he was not the owner. He intended to deceive the insurer in that regard. Evidence (on the part of the father, the son, and an employee of the insurer’s agent) that the father contributed to the payments for the car and for the insurance premiums was “not believed.” Neither the father nor the cousin had any interest in the car. Both the son and the father “intentionally misrepresented” to the insurer that the father was the owner of the car in order to induce the insurer to insure the car, and they continued their misrepresentations through their testimony. The representations were material and the insurer relied on them. At some time before July 30, 1968, there was some communication between the insurer and the father and son about the insurer’s contention that it was not liable by reason of misrepresentation as to ownership. The insurer, therefore, was entitled to disclaim liability on all but the compulsory coverage, and it acted within a reasonable time. There was no waiver or estoppel. The rights of Miss Nigrelli as intervener stood no higher than those of the father and son; her recovery against the insurer therefore was limited to $5,000 for personal injuries. It was unnecessary to decide whether the insurer could disclaim liability on the noncom-pulsory coverage on the ground of noncooperation of the insured.
A final decree was entered in accordance with the findings. The father and son moved for a new trial on the ground that the attorney engaged by the insurer to represent them in the tort action also represented the insurer in this suit against them. The motion was denied, and the ' father and son and Miss Nigrelli appeal both from the final decree and from the denial of the motion for a new trial. The case was transferred to this court from the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 211A, § 10 (B).
1. Intent. The father and son and the intervener rely on G. L. c. 175, § 186, and Jertson v. Hartley, 342 Mass. 597, 602 (1961). In the Jertson case, on facts very similar to those of the present case, we said, “The intentional furnishing of false information of a material nature either before or at trial is a breach of the cooperation clause.... It could be found that the statements were not made with an intention to deceive but were due to their ignorance of what might be the legal consequences of their acts.” The same inference might have been drawn from the evidence in the present case, but it was not. Cf. Williams v. Travelers Ins. Co. 330 Mass. 476, 479 (1953); Cassidy v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. 338 Mass. 139, 142 (1958). The decree appealed from provides, in the words of the statute, that the misrepresentation of the father was made “with actual intent to deceive” the insurer. Unless that finding is plainly wrong, we should not disturb it. In the view we take of the other issues in the case, we do not consider whether it is plainly wrong.
2. Materiality. Even if there is “actual intent to deceive,” the policy is voidable for misrepresentation only if the fact represented is material. Sullivan v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. 342 Mass. 649, 658 (1961). A fact “must be regarded as material, the knowledge or ignorance of which would naturally influence the judgment of the underwriter in making the contract at all, or in estimating the degree and character of the risk, or in fixing the rate of the premium.” Daniels v. Hudson River Fire Ins. Co. 12 Cush. 416, 425 (1853). The judge found that the misrepresentations of the father and son “were of a material fact in the application for, and negotiation of the liability policy in question.” Neither the judge’s findings nor the insurer’s brief, however, gives any hint of a way in which it could make any difference to the insurer whether the car belonged to the father or to the son, so long as the son was the principal operator.
We have searched the testimony for some basis for the judge’s finding, and have found none. An employee of the insurer’s agent was called as a witness by the insurer and testified that the father had been a customer of the insurer’s agent for ten or fifteen years, and that she knew and recognized the father and the son and knew they lived together. She testified that “if a father had a son under twenty-five and wanted to register it, we would tell him it would be better if he bought the car and registered it in his name. He would have more control on the car.” Apparently a bill of sale to the father would have satisfied her, as it later satisfied the insurer’s investigator. But we do not understand how a bill of sale in the father’s name would have given him any more control than did the registration in his name.
The insurer was on notice, as we all are, that in family groups living together in harmony property arrangements are often informal and ambiguous. See, e.g., Robinson v. Robinson, ante, 582, 588 (1974). There must be a great many families in which it is not clear who “really” owns which car. If the insurer is correct in its contention in this case, it is free, whenever a loss occurs, to search out such ambiguities, trace whose earnings were used and which of two comakers of a note was the real borrower, and litigate questions of intra-family ownership for years, delaying the while the day when it must pay a tort judgment. The prospect is not attractive. We think in such a case the insurer must at least show that it had some legitimate concern with the ownership question it raises. Cf. Lombardi v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. 361 Mass. 310, 311-312 (1972). There was no evidence here that the son sought to conceal his age or to avoid increased premium rates or limitations of coverage. Cf. Didlake v. Standard Ins. Co. 195 F. 2d 247, 251 (10th Cir. 1952); Western States Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. May, 18 Ill. App. 2d 442, 448 (1958); Peil v. Kohnke, 50 Wis. 2d 168, 199 (1971). We think the finding that the “fact” represented was material was without support in the evidence. Cf. Western Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Herman, 318 F. 2d 50, 55 (8th Cir. 1963); Standard Acc. Ins. Co. v. Starks, 351 F. 2d 895, 896-897 (6th Cir. 1965); Industrial Indem. Co. v. United States Fid. & Guar. Cos. 93 Idaho 59, 62-63 (1969); Scott v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. 202 Va. 579, 584 (1961).
3. Promptness of disclaimer. On January 5, 1967, when the son made his written report to the insurer’s investigator, the insurer knew in substance all that it now knows about the ownership of the car. Thereafter the insurer paid the collision loss to the father as owner of the car and retained counsel for the father and son. So far as appears from the record, the same attorney continues to represent them in the tort action, the insurer still retains about $125 in premium for coverages it now claims were never in force, and no notice of reservation of rights or disclaimer was given until this suit was begun on July 30, 1968, a year and a half after the insurer discovered the facts.
The only testimony as to when the insureds learned that the insurance company was not going to pay is set forth in the margin. That testimony does not support the judge’s finding that the matter was discussed at some time before this suit was begun on July 30,1968.
Where an insurer gives the insured notice of disclaimer of liability as soon as possible after it learns of the ground therefor, it may continue to defend the action against the insured, at least if the insured acquiesces. Salonen v. Paanenen, 320 Mass. 568, 572-575 (1947). Where an insurer has received conflicting information, we have upheld delay in disclaimer until the conflict was resolved. Sanborn v. Brunette, 315 Mass. 231, 236-237 (1943). Sweeney v. Frew, 318 Mass. 595, 598-599 (1945). Gleason v. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. 331 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1954). But if the insurer knows of its right to disclaim and exercises dominion over the case at an important point without disclaiming liability or reserving rights, subsequent disclaimer is barred. Rose v. Regan, 344 Mass. 223, 227-229 (1962).
In the present case, any misrepresentation related more to the legal consequence of the acts of the insureds than to the acts themselves. Cf. Jertson v. Hartley, 342 Mass. 597, 602 (1961). It could not be said, as was said in Sanborn v. Brunette, 315 Mass. 231, 236 (1943), “Whether the company could successfully disclaim depended upon the story that... [the insureds] would definitely adhere to at the trial.” In situations like the present one, we think the insurer loses its right to disclaim when it knows the facts, fails to disclaim within a reasonable time, and acts in a way inconsistent with an intention to disclaim. Merchants Indem. Corp. v. Eggleston, 37 N. J. 114, 130-132 (1962). Cf. Western Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Herman, 318 F. 2d 50, 55-56 (8th Cir. 1963); Industrial Indem. Co. v. United States Fid. & Guar. Cos. 93 Idaho 59, 63 (1969); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Keller, 17 Ill. App. 2d 44, 50-51 (1958). See Restatement: Contracts, §§ 483, 484 (1932); Williston, Contracts, § 1527 (3d ed. 1970); Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9254 (1968). The delay here was too great, and any right to disclaim was lost.
In arriving at this conclusion, we do not take into account the insureds’ contention that there was a conflict of interest on the part of counsel. Cf. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Keller, 17 Ill. App. 2d 44, 52-53 (1958). The record does not show that counsel was aware of the conflict for any substantial period of time before he notified the insureds.
4. Disposition. The final decree is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court. A new final decree is to be entered declaring that the insurer has no right to disclaim liability under the policy and indorsement issued by it. The appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial is treated as waived. The defendants and intervener are to have costs of appeal.
So ordered.
“No oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.”
Cross-examination of the son by counsel for the defendants:
Q. “Did you ever receive any communication from anybody on behalf of the company, either through the agent, the company, or its attorney, that they were not going to honor this coverage under this policy?” A. “Not for quite a while after I received the summons from Miss Nigrelli, I received an — I don’t know, five, six, seven months after the accident, I received a notice, I believe from Superior Court, that the insurance company wasn’t going to cover.” Q. “When they brought that law suit, was that the first time you were ever apprised that there was any question about their coverage?” A. “Yes.”","Here is the concise holding from the case:

The insurer lost the right to disclaim liability coverage under the policy due to intentional misrepresentation of ownership by the insured, because the misrepresentation was not material and the insurer failed to disclaim within a reasonable time after learning the facts.","Where father and son live in the same household and the insurer has notice that they will share custody and use of the vehicle, misrepresentations about the ""true owner"" of the vehicle are not material."
"OPINION
LARSEN, Justice.
This appeal involves a declaratory judgment action filed by appellee, Frances M. Zerance, guardian of the estate of Nicholas A. Zerance (insured), seeking judicial construction of a group medical benefits insurance policy issued pursuant to a group plan by the appellant, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (Guardian Life). The policy in question provided for, inter alia, medical and health benefits coverage for employees of Middletown East End Warehouse Company (Middletown) who qualified under the group plan. We are asked to construe the group insurance policy to determine whether the appellant properly terminated the insured’s disability benefit payments as of December 31, 1979. The controversy arose in the following background.
In 1974, Nicholas A. Zerance was an employee of Middle-town. He was insured under the group insurance policy issued by Guardian Life. On February 16, 1974, the insured became disabled due to certain after-effects of surgery. As a result of the disability, he has required extensive medical and nursing care on a continuing basis. The medical and nursing expenses necessitated by his disability were covered under the Guardian Life group medical policy from February 16, 1974 until December 31, 1979.
In November, 1978, appellee, Frances M. Zerance, as guardian of the insured, was informed by Middletown that the insurance coverage would be terminated on November 30, 1978. On November 30, 1978, Middletown cancelled its group policy with Guardian Life effective December 1, 1978. The appellant continued to pay medical and nursing expenses for the insured until December 31, 1979. At that time, pursuant to the terms of the policy, all benefits were terminated. The policy provisions under which benefit payments were discontinued provide as follows:
“Termination of Your Insurance.
The group policy provides that your insurance will terminate upon the earlier of: (a) The date the group policy terminates or is amended to terminate insurance on the class or classes of employees to which you belong or (b) The date your employment terminates. This means that the date you cease to be actively at work on a full time basis with your employer, except that under certain circumstances specified in the Group Policy, your employment may be deemed, for the purposes of the insurance, to continue for a limited period after such cessation. In addition, if you fail to make the required contribution, when due, for any benefits for which you are required to contribute, such benefits will terminate at the end of the period for which you made the last required contribution.
‘Coverage after Termination.
If this insurance terminates for any reason (other than for non-payment of premium or because of exhaustion of the total benefit after age 65) and on such date of termination you or your dependent are totally disabled and under the care of a physician, coverage pertaining solely to the injury or sickness which caused the total disability will be extended during the uninterrupted continuance of such total disability subject to all limitations and provisions of this major medical expense coverage. Covered charges which would otherwise be payable for complications of pregnancy shall also be paid after termination of insurance provided the pregnancy had its inception prior to the date of the termination of insurance.
“This extension of insurance shall terminate on the earliest of the following occurrences: (a) The date these benefits are replaced by another plan providing similar benefits (other than a group policy issued by the Guardian) and under which you or your dependent are a member of the classes eligible; (b) The date total disability ends but in no event beyond the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which your insurance terminated.”
The trial court, treating the case as a non-jury civil action, received evidence and concluded that the cancellation of the group insurance was effective and binding on the insured. A verdict was entered in favor of Guardian Life. Appellee’s exceptions were denied and judgment was entered in accordance with the verdict. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, holding that the insured’s right to the payment of benefits was vested and the termination provision of the policy may not be construed to divest that right. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and hold that the termination provisions of the Guardian Life group insurance contract are valid and the insured is bound by the language of the policy.
Generally, in group insurance policies, the insurance carrier and the employer are the primary contracting parties and the rights of an insured employee are no greater than as provided by the terms of the policy. Brown v. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp., 168 Pa.Super. 380, 77 A.2d 655 (1951). Where it is consistent with the provisions of the policy, and notice of the intended cancellation is given to the insured, the employer may cancel the policy and thereby terminate the coverage of the individual employees.
The appellee argues that the insured’s right to benefits under the Guardian Life group policy fully vested at the time he became disabled, and the subsequent cancellation of the policy cannot divest that right. The appellee relies on Turley v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, 315 Pa. 245, 173 A. 163 (1934) as controlling this case. Appellee’s reliance on Turley is ill-founded.
In Turley, the insured died and his widow made a claim for a $1,000.00 insurance benefit under the terms of a group policy. The group insurance provided a death benefit payable in a lump sum in the event of death to the named beneficiary. The policy also provided:
“In the event of total and permanent disability, occurring before the age of 60,____the____insurance----will become payable to the member himself in a single sum.”
If total and permanent disability occurs after the age of 60, the insurance will be paid only when death occurs.”
Id., 315 Pa. at 247, 173 A. at 164. The insured became totally and permanently disabled after the age of 60 and subsequently died. The only defense raised to the widow’s suit was that the insured had been discharged from his employment prior to his death and he failed to convert the insurance. The defense concluded that because of the insured’s discharge and his failure to convert, there was no liability under the policy. The question before the court then was whether the discharge affected the insured’s rights as urged by the defendants. In upholding Turley’s widow’s right to the insurance benefit, we said:
Undoubtedly this contention would be sound had not a member’s substantive right prior thereto become fixed. Turley became totally and permanently disabled when he was a member of the association and an employee of the company. He was unable to continue his employment. When that condition arose he became entitled to the benefit from the insurance to be paid to his beneficiary at death. His rights became vested. True, the benefit was not to be enjoyed until death, but his beneficiary was then to receive it. Rights are vested when the right to enjoyment, present or prospective, has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present interest. Turley was not able to work after being disabled, of course; his rights were fixed and determined ... when he was forced to leave his work because of disability. It was not the intent and purpose of the “Plan of Protection” to oust a man from the association, as well as from the company, who had become permanently disabled after he was 60. The “Plan of Protection” distinctly says otherwise.”
Id., 315 Pa. at 249-250, 173 A. at 165. The insurance contract in Turley provided that when an insured became totally and permanently disabled, a lump sum benefit vested. The time when payment of that benefit was due depended upon the age of the disabled insured. If the insured was under 60 years of age payment was due immediately to the insured himself. If the insured was over the age of 60 then payment was due upon his death. The total and permanent disability of the insured activated the insurer’s obligation to pay the lump sum benefit and vested the insured’s right to receive it. Under the terms of the policy, this obligation of the insurer and right of the insured was not dependent upon continuation of the insurance contract.
The issue in the case sub judice goes beyond the question of whether the insured’s right to benefit payments became vested when he suffered his disability. Indeed, subject to the terms of the policy, the disability of the insured activated his right to receive reimbursement for necessary medical expenses as such expenses were incurred. The question here is whether that right can be terminated by cancellation of the policy.
The clear provisions of the termination clause in question were part of the insurance contract from its inception. Payment of medical benefits to a disabled insured was specifically subject to those provisions. The insured’s right to benefit payments can rise no higher than as provided by the terms of the policy. Under the policy, cancellation extinguished the right to benefits, subject to the provisions extending benefits in particular cases. When the insurance terminated for any reason other than non-payment of premium or exhaustion of benefits, the policy provided for “coverage after termination” which extended the insurance coverage until, “the date total disability ends but in no event beyond the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which [the] insurance terminated.” Where the policy language is unambiguous, a court cannot adopt a construction which conflicts with the clear meaning of the language. Patton v. Patton, 413 Pa. 566, 198 A.2d 578 (1964). Language in a policy that is clear cannot be interpreted to mean other than what it plainly says. Judge v. Prudential Insurance Co., 321 Pa. 454, 184 A. 543 (1936). The language in the policy in question is clear and unambiguous and must be enforced as written.
The appellant, Guardian Life followed the policy provisions to the letter, providing benefits from the date of disability until December 31, 1979 — the last day of the calendar year which followed the year in which the insurance was cancelled. The appellee argues that the appellant is liable for the payment of benefits until the policy limit of $250,000.00 is exhausted. This monetary limitation is, however, subject to the termination provisions of the insurance contract. The appellant was liable for benefit payments up to $250,000.00 or until the right to benefits was otherwise terminated. Here, the right to benefits was otherwise terminated by the cancellation of the policy. We may not rewrite the insurance contract, under the guise of judicial interpretation, to expand the coverage beyond that as provided in the policy.
The appellee next argues that if the policy must be construed as terminating the insured’s benefits following cancellation of the contract, then the termination provisions are void as against public policy. The provisions in question specifically provide a qualified insured with insurance coverage for a reasonable time after the policy terminates. We can discern no public policy that forbids such provisions.
“Public policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interest.”
Muschany v. United States, 324 U.S. 49, 65 S.Ct. 442, 89 L.Ed. 744 (1945). In Mamlin v. Genoe, 340 Pa. 320,17 A.2d 407, 409 (1941), Justice Stern, writing for this Court, stated:
“It is only when a given policy is so obviously for or against the public health, safety, morals or welfare that there is a virtual unaminity of opinion in regard to it, that a court may constitute itself the voice of the community in [declaring that policy to be against public policy].”
We find no such unaminity of opinion against the policy terms challenged in this case. The termination provisions are not obviously against the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the people.
“Only in the clearest of cases ... may a court make an alleged public policy the basis of judicial decision.”
Id., 340 Pa. at 409, 17 A.2d at 409. The provisions in question are lawful and not contrary to any public policy of Pennsylvania.
Finally, the appellee argues that the appellant should be estopped from denying coverage until the policy limit of $250,000.00 is reached. Appellee bases her estoppel argument on a memo dated June 26, 1974 from Middletown to appellee and the insured informing them of the coverage under the policy. The memo was based upon, information received from one Joan Masny, an agent of Guardian Life. The memo advised that expenses for doctor visits, drugs, registered nurse, hospital bed, wheel chair, crutches, walkers, ambulance service and physical therapy were covered up to $250,000.00 without limit as to the number of days. Appellee’s contention is that because the memo states that the expense items set forth would be covered up to the policy limit, the appellant is estopped from denying coverage until that limit is exhausted.
“[EJstoppel arises when one by his acts, representations, or admissions, or by his silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally or through culpable negligence induces another to believe certain facts to exist and such other rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the existence of such facts. In this situation, the person inducing the belief in the existence of a certain state of facts is estopped to deny that the state of facts does in truth exist, aver a different or contrary state of facts as existing at the same time, or deny or repudiate his acts, conduct or statements.” (citations omitted)
Northwestern National Bank v. Commonwealth, 345 Pa. 192, 27 A.2d 20 (1942).
“The essential elements of estoppel are an inducement by the party sought to be estopped to the party who asserts the estoppel to believe certain facts to exist, and reliance by the party asserting the estoppel on that belief.”
Sabino v. Junio, 441 Pa. 222, 272 A.2d 508 (1971).
In the instant case, the appellee asserts that the appellant, by the memo of June 26, 1974, induced the appellee to believe the insured’s medical expenses would be covered up to the policy limit of $250,000.00, and that she and the insured justifiably relied upon that belief to her and the insured’s prejudices. Accordingly, the argument goes on, the appellant should be estopped from denying payment of benefits up to the stated policy limit. The flaw in appellee’s argument is that there is no evidence establishing the essential element of prejudicial reliance on the part of the appellee or the insured. The memo allegedly relied upon, written in response to a request made by appellee, merely informs appellee of the coverage under the policy. That coverage, of course, was subject to all of the terms of the policy, including the termination provisions. When the memo was sent to the appellee the insured was already disabled and there is no evidence of any action taken or omitted by appellee or the insured in reliance on the information contained in the memo. The appellee did testify that because of the benefits outlined in the memo she continued her employment. She stated that the benefits enabled her to remain employed and have the insured at home under the care of a private nurse. Without the benefits she could not have afforded this in-home care. We find no prejudicial reliance on these facts.
The order of the Superior Court is reversed and judgment of the trial court is reinstated.

. On June 3, 1983, the Superior Court entered the following:
""On Consideration Whereof it is now hereby ordered and adjudged by this Court that the Judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County in favor of the Appellee, Guardian Life is reversed. Judgment entered in favor of the Appellant for the balance of the two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) of disability benefits.”
On August 15, 1983, the Superior Court entered the following Amended Order:
“Accordingly, we hold that the judgment in favor of the appellee, Guardian Life, is reversed. Appellant is entitled to have the expense covered by the disability benefits paid until the Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollar ($250,000.00) major medical allowance is exhausted. We remand to the lower court to determine that covered expenses have been incurred by the appellant for her husband since December 31, 1979.”
. See: Poch v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of United States, 343 Pa. 119, 22 A.2d 590 (1941).
. The policy provided that the insurance terminated upon termination of membership in the employees’ association unless the insured elected to continue the coverage under the conversion privilege contained in the contract. (When Turley was discharged from his employment, his membership in the Employee’s Association terminated).
. See: ""Coverage After Termination” clause set forth, supra.
. The Guardian Life Group policy provided:
“Maximum amount payable under major medical expenses for each sickness or injury — $250,000.00.
“Maximum amount payable under major medical expense for all sicknesses and injuries to those age 65 and over — $250,000.00.”","Here is a concise holding for this case:

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the termination provisions in Guardian Life's group insurance policy were valid and enforceable. The court ruled that Guardian Life properly terminated the insured's disability benefit payments as of December 31, 1979 in accordance with the clear and unambiguous policy language. The insured's right to benefits could not exceed what was provided for in the policy terms.","Where the insured's policy clearly states a termination date for benefits, and where there the terms are not contrary to public policy and estoppel is not applicable, the insurer may terminate vested benefits in accordance with that policy, regardless of whether the benefit limit has been reached."
"Per Curiam.
Defendant appeals as of right from the trial court’s order granting plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition, brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10), and denying defendant’s motion for summary disposition, brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4), (5), (7), (8) and (10). Defendant raises several issues on appeal. We affirm.
On October 25, 1976, the State of Michigan, the Air Pollution Control Commission and plaintiff, the Michigan Department of Treasury, sought a declaratory judgment that the City of Detroit was required and had failed to pay surveillance fees imposed pursuant to the Air Pollution Act, MCL 336.11 et seq.; MSA 14.58(1) et seq. Defendant, Central Wayne County Sanitation Authority, was permitted to intervene as a defendant. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and, by its order of August 28, 1981, the trial court granted summary judgment in plaintiff’s favor and ordered the City of Detroit and defendant to ""pay any and all delinquent surveillance fees due and owing as of the date of this Order . . . .” The court’s order was affirmed on appeal. Michigan v Detroit, 130 Mich App 503; 343 NW2d 597 (1983), lv gtd 422 Mich 857 (1985), order granting lv vacated and lv den 424 Mich 894 (1986).
On April 8, 1986, plaintiff billed defendant for the unpaid surveillance fees from 1975 to 1984 and sought interest owed on the unpaid fees pursuant to MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. Although defendant paid the surveillance fees, it did not pay the $52,647.74 of accrued interest. On March 20, 1987, plaintiff filed this action to collect the interest on the judgment entered against defendant on August 28, 1981.
First, defendant contends the trial court erred in finding that the judgment entered on August 28, 1981, was a money judgment recovered in a civil action within the meaning of § 6013(1), which provides in relevant part:
Interest shall be allowed on a money judgment recovered in a civil action, as provided in this section, except that for complaints filed on or after October 1, 1986, interest shall not be allowed on future damages from the date of filing the complaint to the date of entry of the judgment.
The purpose of an award under this section is to compensate the prevailing party for the delay in its receiving money damages. McCahill v Commercial Union Ins Co, 179 Mich App 761, 777; 446 NW2d 579 (1989). The allowance of interest under §6013(1) is mandatory, Goins v Ford Motor Co, 131 Mich App 185, 201-202; 347 NW2d 184 (1983), lv den 424 Mich 879 (1986), while in equitable actions, the question of interest is a discretionary matter for the trial court. Cyranoski v Keenan, 363 Mich 288, 294-295; 109 NW2d 815 (1961).
A money judgment is one which adjudges the payment of a sum of money as distinguished from directing an act to be done. Marina Bay Condominiums, Inc v Schlegel, 167 Mich App 602, 609; 423 NW2d 284 (1988), lv den 431 Mich 905 (1988). Here, the trial court’s August 28, 1981, order stated:
It is further ordered that defendant and Intervening defendant pay any and all delinquent Surveillance Fees due and owing as of the date of this order ....
On its face, the order was clearly a money judgment.
Defendant argues that, because plaintiffs 1976 complaint was an action solely for declaratory relief and not seeking specific money damages, the judgment on that complaint was not a money judgment. However, in its first amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant had been billed for surveillance fees for 1974 in the amount of $8,000. In addition, plaintiff sought , entry of a judgment declaring that defendant pay plaintiff the surveillance fees owed for 1974. Thus, plaintiff sought not only a judgment declaring defendant responsible for air pollution surveillance fees, but also payment of the 1974 surveillance fees, for which defendant had been billed. Furthermore, the award of interest pursuant to § 6013 would effectuate the legislative purpose of compensating plaintiff for its loss of use of the surveillance fees, the majority of which were due and owing well before the trial court’s order.
We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument that, because plaintiff billed defendant for and sought in its original action only the surveillance fees for 1974, plaintiff was only entitled to interest on those fees. Section 6013(1) allows interest on the money judgment recovered, not on the amount originally sought.
Second, defendant contends that the trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs action for statutory interest. In Hendrickson v Moghissi, 158 Mich App 290, 295; 404 NW2d 728 (1987), this Court stated:
[T]he Michigan Constitution vests the circuit court with broad original jurisdiction over all matters, particularly civil, so long as jurisdiction is not expressly prohibited by law. Const 1963, art 6, § 13. [DAIIE v Maurizio], 129 Mich App [166, 172; 341 NW2d 262 (1983)]. Subject matter jurisdiction in particular is defined as the court’s ability "" 'to exercise judicial power over that class of cases; not the particular case before it, but rather the abstract power to try a case of the kind or character of the one pending.’ ” 129 Mich App 172, citing Joy v Two-Bit Corp, 287 Mich 244, 253; 183 NW 45 (1938). Circuit court jurisdiction over a particular subject matter is denied only by constitution or statute. MCL 600.605; MSA 27A.605. In construing such statutes or constitutional provisions, retention of jurisdiction is presumed and any intent to divest the circuit court of jurisdiction must be clearly and unambiguously stated. 129 Mich App 174, citing Leo v Atlas Industries, Inc, 370 Mich 400, 402; 121 NW2d 926 (1963), and Crane v Reeder, 28 Mich 527, 532-533 (1874).
Defendant does not point to any constitutional or statutory provision denying the circuit court jurisdiction over an action for interest pursuant to § 6013. Defendant merely asserts that there is no cognizable cause of action for the payment of interest. Such a contention, without supporting authority, does not persuade us that the circuit court was without subject matter jurisdiction.
Third, defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary disposition on the ground of res judicata. Defendant argues that plaintiff was barred from litigating the issue of interest, because no payment of interest was ordered in the 1981 judgment.
We have determined that the 1981 judgment was a money judgment. Consequently, the allowance of interest on that judgment was mandatory under §6013. See Goins, supra; Alpine Construction Co v Gilliland, 50 Mich App 568, 577; 213 NW2d 824 (1973). A prevailing party is entitled to the statutory interest on his money judgment even though the order of judgment did not expressly provide for interest. Alpine, supra. Therefore, the prior judgment does not act to bar litigating the issue of interest; rather, it is the basis on which plaintiff is entitled to interest under § 6013. The trial court properly denied defendant’s summary disposition motion based on its claim of res judicata.
Fourth, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that plaintiff had the legal capacity to bring an independent action for the interest on the judgment, because the collection of interest is not an authorized activity under either MCL 14.131 et seq.; MSA 3.231 et seq., or MCL 205.1 et seq.; MSA 7.657(1) et seq. MCL 14.131; MSA 3.231 provides that a collection department under the attorney general’s supervision and control shall be created ""for the purpose of collecting all past due monies and accounts which are owing to the State of Michigan or any department, commission or institution thereof.” The collection department is authorized to enforce payment and collection of past due money owing to the state and to bring suit to do so. MCL 14.133, 14.134; MSA 3.233, 3.234. MCL 205.13; MSA 7.657(13) provides in relevant part:
The department [of revenue] shall administer and enforce the following laws as amended and shall succeed to and is hereby vested with all of the powers, duties, functions, responsibilities and jurisdiction now or hereafter conferred upon:
(h) The department shall succeed to and is hereby vested with all powers, duties, functions, responsibilities and jurisdiction of the attorney general over the collection of all past due moneys and accounts which are owing to the state of Michigan or any department, commission or institution thereof, heretofore vested in the attorney general by Act No. 375 of the Public Acts of 1927, being sections 14.131 to 14.134, inclusive, of the Compiled Laws of 1948.
By those statutes, plaintiff was empowered to bring suit to collect ""past due monies,” which would reasonably include the statutory interest at issue. Defendant’s claim that the statutes discussed above do not expressly provide for the collection of ""interest” is of no merit.
Fifth, defendant contends that plaintiff’s claim for interest is barred by the- statute of limitations and, although defendant refers to MCL 600.5801 et seq.; MSA 27A.5801 et seq., it does not specify the statute of limitations which applies here. An appellant may not merely announce his position and leave it to this Court to discover and rationalize the basis for his claim. Sargent v Browning-Ferris Industries, 167 Mich App 29, 32-33; 421 NW2d 563 (1988). Although defendant suggests that the period of limitation was six years, MCL 600.5809(3); MSA 27A.5809(3) provides that the period of limitations is ten years ""for actions founded upon judgments or decrees rendered in a court of record of this state . . . .” Plaintiff’s 1987 action for interest was based on the 1981 judgment, and the claim for interest under § 6013 did not accrue until the judgment was rendered. Thus, plaintiff’s action for interest was within the applicable statute of limitations.
Defendant points out that plaintiff did not seek surveillance fees for any year other than 1974, and argues that, as a result, any claim for interest on the unpaid surveillance fees for 1975 through the date of the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations. The judgment, however, ordered payment of all delinquent surveillance fees due and owing as of August 28, 1981, the date of Judge Duggan’s order. A challenge to that part of the order requiring payment of surveillance fees owed for the years subsequent to 1974 would properly be made by appeal from the 1981 judgment, and defendant’s appeal does not appear to have included that issue. See Michigan v Detroit, supra. Plaintiffs claim for interest under § 6013 accrued at the time the judgment was issued, not when the surveillance fee was due. Therefore, the statute of limitations began to run on August 28, 1981, the date of Judge Duggan’s order.
Finally, defendant contends that the trial court erred in not specifying in its order the amount of interest owed to plaintiff and in ordering the payment of interest at the statutory rate set forth in § 6013(2). Although plaintiff argues that MCR 2.517(A)(1) required the court to specify the amount of interest owed, MCR 2.517(A)(4) provides that findings of fact are unnecessary in decisions on motions. Here, the trial court’s order provided in relevant part:
It is further ordered and adjudged that Defendant pay Plaintiff interest on the aforementioned judgment at the statutory rate as set forth in MCL 600.6013(2); MSA 27A.6013(2).
Section 6013(2) provides:
For complaints filed before June 1, 1980, in an action involving other than a written instrument having a rate of interest exceeding 6% per year, the interest on the judgment shall be calculated from the date of filing the complaint to June 1, 1980, at the rate of 6% per year and on and after June 1, 1980, to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually.
We are persuaded that the trial court’s order was adequate in specifying the method used for computing the interest owed by defendant. Furthermore, the complaint to which § 6013(2) refers can only be plaintiff’s amended complaint, filed on March 7, 1977, which alleged that defendant was required to pay, and owed, surveillance fees. Because the amended complaint was filed before June 1, 1980, computation of the interest owed by defendant was proper under § 6013(2).
Affirmed.","Here is a concise holding for this case:

The trial court's order granting summary judgment for the plaintiff and requiring the defendant to pay statutory interest on the delinquent surveillance fees was affirmed, as the order was a money judgment and the plaintiff was entitled to mandatory statutory interest under MCL 600.6013. The circuit court had jurisdiction over the interest claim, it was not barred by res judicata, and the plaintiff had legal capacity to bring suit to collect the interest. The claim was also timely filed within the 10 year statute of limitations for actions founded on judgments.","A judgment for unpaid fees was a monetary judgment and thus subject to the statute for relative interest, even though plaintiff originally only sought declaratory relief because the plaintiff also asked the court for payment of fees owed. Further, the interest applies to ""all monies due"", not just the fees for the single year originally sought by plaintiff"
"OPINION
MONTOYA, Justice.
This is an appeal by plaintiff Ruth L. Watkins from the granting of a motion to dismiss rendered in favor of defendants in an action brought in the District Court of Los Alamos County seeking injunctive relief and money damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1970), because of defendants’ refusal to reemploy the plaintiff as a certified classroom teacher at Los Alamos High School for the school year 1971-1972 and thereafter. For convenience, the parties will be referred to as they appeared below.
The facts alleged in plaintiff’s first amended complaint, deemed admitted by the motion to dismiss, are as follows. The Local School Board of Los Alamos Schools, the individual members thereof, and its superintendent, are all named defendants. Plaintiff was a certified school teacher and was employed as a non-tenure teacher by the Los Alamos School Board for the school years 1968-1969, 1969-1970 and 1970-1971. Plaintiff performed her teaching and related duties and assignments during her three years of employment in a competent and satisfactory manner and alleges she had a reasonable and objective expectancy that her teaching contract would be renewed for the 1971-1972 school year and thereafter. Moreover, that because of plaintiff’s successful completion of three years of teaching with the Los Alamos Schools and because of the Board’s written and unwritten policies and practices, the plaintiff possessed a legitimate claim of entitlement to job tenure and, in the alternative, plaintiff possessed de facto tenure.
Plaintiff further alleges that the Board’s decision to terminate her employment was made at a special meeting of the Board on May 18, 1971, which was reconvened into an alleged open meeting which was in fact procedurally defective and in violation of § 5-6-17, N.M.S.A., 1953, and the Los Ala-mos Schools Regulations. The plaintiff also alleges that because of procedural defects, the defendants’ decision to terminate the plaintiff constituted an unlawful exercise of administrative power and “was in violation of Section 5-6-7 [sic], N.M.S.A., 1953 Comp.,” and in violation of the regulations of the Los Alamos Schools.
It is further alleged that the Board failed and refused to comply with the State Board of Education Regulations concerning the termination of teachers for unsatisfactory work performance, and that the Board’s actions violated the Los Alamos Schools’ policy on supervision and correction. Plaintiff also alleges that the non-renewal of plaintiff’s employment was founded on plaintiff’s expression of opinion on subjects of public interest relating to the Los Alamos school system, and the termination of employment and refusal to reemploy for such reason constitutes a deprivation of plaintiff’s right to freedom of speech protected by the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. Plaintiff further alleges that each and all of the wrongful and illegal acts on the part of the Board and defendant Carroll were done under color of statute, regulation, custom or usage of the State of New Mexico. Plaintiff claims that the Board’s action to terminate and refusal to reemploy her was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the objective expectancy of reemployment possessed by the plaintiff. By reason of the foregoing, plaintiff alleges she suffered certain damages and seeks injunctive relief.
Thereafter, defendants Board, board members and its superintendent filed motions to dismiss on grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted, that the matter was res judicata because of a previous suit, and that an action pursuant to 42 U.S,C. § 1983 cannot be brought against other than individuals. After hearing oral arguments on the motion to dismiss, the trial court dismissed the action on the grounds that it raised matters which are res judicata, having been settled between the parties by final order in cause No. 44376, Santa Fe County District Court. In its order, the trial court stated, as further reasons for dismissal, that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and on the grounds that the complaint, insofar as it sounded in tort against a political subdivision of the State of New Mexico or persons acting in their official capacity as members of the local school board or as superintendent of, schools, was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. This appeal followed.
Plaintiff contends (1) that the holding in cause No. 44376, Santa Fe County District Court, which was a dismissal without prejudice of a suit involving identical parties and issues, did not make this matter res judicata; (2) that the plaintiff did not fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; (3) that this matter is not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; and (4) that the trial court erred in ruling that the defendant school board was not a person within the language of 42 U. S.C. § 1983.
Perhaps to place the trial court’s judgment in proper perspective, it should be pointed out that prior to the instant cause being filed in Los Alamos County District Court, the same plaintiff had filed a complaint seeking a mandatory injunction and money damages in the District Court of Santa Fe County in cause No. 44376. The Santa Fe County action alleged some but not all of the theories of recovery and relief alleged in the instant case. That cause was heard by District Judge Edwin L. Fel-ter and he dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The same order of dismissal by Judge Felter contained the following language :
“At the election of the Plaintiff, she shall have 20 days from the date of this Order to file an Amended Complaint in this cause.”
In addition, Judge Felter’s decision in the Santa Fe County case was based on his holding that the plaintiff was not a tenure teacher, that her claim of entitlement to employment is
“merely a unilateral expectation, and therefore, the Complaint filed herein fails to state a cause of action * *
We first need to consider the effect of Judge Felter’s decision in the Santa Fe County District Court case dismissing the action “without prejudice” and which also gave plaintiff an election to file an amended complaint within twenty days. No action to amend the complaint was taken, nor was there an appeal taken from the ruling of dismissal. Accordingly, that ruling stands and is binding upon the parties.
In Chavez v. Myers, 11 N.M. 333, 68 P. 917 (1902), we ruled that a party to an action who does not appeal is presumed to be satisfied with the judgment rendered by the court below. See also Laura v. Christian, 88 N.M. 127, 537 P.2d 1389 (1975). The plaintiff, not having taken advantage of the election afforded her to amend her complaint, is bound by the judgment entered against her in the Santa Fe County District Court action. See Meeker v. Walker, 80 N.M. 280, 454 P.2d 762 (1969); Board v. Cross, 12 N.M. 72, 73 P. 615 (1903).
It also appears to us that the first action filed by plaintiff in the Santa Fe County District Court case determined the “right” of the plaintiff to pursue her action based upon her claim of being wrongfully deprived of her “right” to continued employment in the Los Alamos School system. That was decided by the Santa Fe County District Court as a matter of law based upon the facts deemed admitted as contained in the complaint filed in that cause. The Santa Fe County District Court in its order dismissing the action ruled as follows :
“That the Complaint herein be dismissed on the grounds that the right of a teacher to future employment or the claim of entitlement to employment is governed by the tenure laws of New Mexico and, therefore, unless a teacher has an existing contract that is unexpired; or one that is automatically renewed by failure to give notice; or if the teacher is a tenure teacher, there is no right to future employment under the laws of the State of New Mexico, and any claim of entitlement to employment by the Plaintiff herein is merely a unilateral expectation, and therefore, the Complaint filed herein fails to state a cause of action, and it is hereby Ordered dismissed without prejudice.”
In this case filed in the Los Alamos County District Court we have no new “right” alleged that is different from that alleged in the Santa Fe County action. Nothing new is alleged in the new complaint which could not have been stated in the former complaint. In Board v. Cross, supra, we quoted from Judge Brewer’s opinion in Patterson v. Wold, 33 F. 791 (D.Minn.1888), as follows (12 N.M. at 78, 73 P. at 617):
“ ‘It is true, the basis of complainant’s primary right is, as alleged, different in one case from that in the other; but this is mere difference, in the language of the Supreme Court, “in the grounds of recovery.” The mere fact that different testimony would be necessary to sustain the different allegations in the two bills, does not of itself, necessarily make two distinct causes of action ... In both of such actions plaintiffs’ primary right . . . would be the same; the only difference being in the grounds of recovery. All the grounds of recovery, all the basis of plaintiff’s title, must be presented in the first action, or they are lost to him forever.’ ”
We feel that the dismissal of the suit filed in the Santa Fe County District Court became final and binding when no amended pleadings were filed in the time given, and no appeal was taken from that court’s ruling. The ruling of the lower court in the instant cause, based upon all of the foregoing, is correct and should be affirmed.
In view of our disposition, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the other issues argued by the parties. The ruling of the trial court is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
McMANUS, €. J., and OMAN, J., concur.","Here is a concise holding based on the case document:

The doctrine of res judicata bars the plaintiff from bringing a second lawsuit alleging wrongful termination after failing to amend her complaint or appeal the dismissal of her first lawsuit alleging the same claims. The dismissal of the first lawsuit without prejudice became a final judgment when the plaintiff failed to amend within the time allowed and did not appeal. Therefore, the second lawsuit alleging the same claims is barred.","The dismissal of the suit filed by the plaintiff in a different court on substantially the same issues became final and binding when no amended pleadings were filed in the time given, and no appeal was taken from that court’s ruling, so the decision by the court to dismiss plaintiff's case on the grounds of res judicata was proper."
"Cureton, Judge:
Claimant Marvin Stephenson appeals the denial of workers’ compensation benefits and the finding of the Full Commission that his work-related injury did not aggravate his pre-existing condition because he was already totally disabled from this disorder prior to his accident. Stephenson appeals. We reverse and remand.
Stephenson filed a workers’ compensation claim based on a work-related aggravation of his pre-existing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The injury which allegedly caused the aggravation of his PTSD occurred March 16, 1988, when Stephenson injured his back after he slipped and fell on a wet loading dock while working at Fort Jackson for his employer, Rice Services, Inc.
Several months prior to this accident, in August 1987, Stephenson was diagnosed by Dr. Doyle, a psychologist with the Veterans Administration (VA), as permanently and totally disabled because of PTSD. Nevertheless, at the time of the accident in March, 1988, Stephenson only had a 30% VA disability rating. Pursuant to Dr. Doyle’s diagnosis, this rating was later retroactively elevated to a 100% disability for PTSD under VA standards.
Despite his disability, however, Stephenson was able to get a job working for Rice Services, Inc. supervising recruits in a mess hall at Fort Jackson. He also had a second part-time job pumping gas and sweeping up at a gas station near his home. Stephenson testified that prior to his accident, he was able to perform his work requirements satisfactorily. Stephenson’s psychologist, Dr. Vander Kolk, further testified he received information indicating Stephenson was a good employee and carried out his assigned duties in a proper manner.
The single commissioner found Stephenson was entitled to total and permanent disability for aggravation of his pre-exciting PTSD, and awarded him 500 weeks of compensation, less the thirty-nine weeks of compensation previously awarded. The Full Commission reversed the commissioner, finding as follows:
[Stephenson] was already permanently and totally disabled prior to his work-related accident on March 16, 1988. Thus, [Stephenson’s] accident of March 16, 1988 did not aggravate the pre-existing post-traumatic stress disorder so as to render [Stephenson] unemployable.
The circuit court found there was substantial evidence to support the finding that Stephenson was totally disabled prior to his accident, and affirmed the Commission.
On appeal, Stephenson argues the Commission impermissibly relied upon the VA rating in denying his claim, and that the finding of total disability from PTSD prior to the accident was not otherwise supported by substantial evidence. We agree that the Commission could not rely upon the VA rating to find Stephenson totally disabled. See 2B Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen’s Compensation § 79.71(b) (“Awards or records made in other proceedings . . . ordinarily cannot be relied on to support or deny a workers’ compensation claim.”); see also Solomon v. W. B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C 518, 521, 415 S.E. (2d) 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992) (disability rating by Social Security Administration was likely not admissible in workers’ compensation action).
As pointed out by the circuit court, Rice Services contends the disability rating given to Stephenson by the VA was not the sole evidence relied upon by the Commission in concluding that Stephenson was already permanently and totally disabled prior to his accident on March 16, 1988. Rice Services maintains the disability rating given by the VA was merely corroborating evidence of Stephenson’s condition. We agree that the Commission did not rely solely on the VA rating, but instead used the same medical evidence developed in the VA files.
Thus, excluding the VA rating from consideration, the issue becomes whether substantial evidence exists to support the Commission’s finding that Stephenson was already permanently disabled prior to his work-related accident on March 16, 1988. See Stokes v. First National Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E. (2d) 248 (1991); Debruhl v. Kershaw Cty. Sheriff's Dept., 303 S.C. 20, 397 S.E. (2d) 782 (Ct. App. 1990) (the Commission’s decision must be affirmed if the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence); see also McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, 307 S.C. 184, 414 S.E. (2d) (“[substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached”).
Stephenson argues that since he was able to return to work and perform his job, he could not have been 100% permanently and totally disabled at the time of his accident. Therefore, he contends, there is insubstantial evidence to support the Commission’s findings. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree.
According to the South Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act (Act), “disability” is the incapacity because of injury, to earn, in the same or some other employment, the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of the injury. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-120 (Law. Co-op. 1985). “Total disability” does not require absolute helplessness or entire physical disability; instead, it is an inability to perform services other than those that are so limited in quality, dependability or quantity that no reasonable stable market exists for them. McCollum v. Singer Co., 300 S.C 103, 386 S.E. (2d) 471 (Ct. App. 1989)
Furthermore, as stated in Outlaw v. Johnson Service Co., 254 S.C. 486, 176 S.E (2d) 152 (1970), the loss of earning capacity alone is the criterion for compensation under the Act and medical opinion as to the extent of physical disability can have no probative value against actual earnings. The undisputed fact that Stephenson w;as able to resume gainful employment and satisfactorily performed his job negates the finding that on March 16,1988 Stephenson had no earning capacity. The testimony of Stephenson’s psychologist also provides evidence of Stephenson’s earning capacity at the time of the accident. Although he had concluded before the injury that Stephenson was not a good candidate for placement, Dr. Vander Kolk testified that Stephenson was able to find a semi-competitive job that “met his particular needs and was in an environment where he could function.”
We conclude on the record before us that there is no substantial evidence that Stephenson was 100% disabled at the time of the accident; both the Full Commission and the circuit court erred as a matter of law when they determined that Stephenson was 100% permanently and totally disabled when the accident occurred. We agree with the single commissioner that the inescapable fact remains that Stephenson was able to find not only one, but two jobs within his limitations and he was able to perform the duties of that employment up until his injury. Since that time, even that narrow window of employment has been closed to him because of the accident.
The evidence in this record does not indicate that Stephenson’s position with Rice Services was so limited in quality, dependability, and quantity that no reasonable stable market existed for that employment. McCollum, supra. The record shows that Stephenson retained some earning capacity before his injury, and the accident and injury of March 16, 1988 aggravated his pre-existing PTSD rendering him totally and permanently disabled.
Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court affirming the Order of the Full Commission and remand to the Commission for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
Howell, C.J., and Shaw, J., concur.
Stephenson received 39 weeks of compensation for the injury to his back, and Rice Services does not appeal the award of benefits for Stephenson’s back injury.
The rating for a prior disability does not necessarily establish the degree of disability at the time of a subsequent injury. Because of advances in modern medical treatment, the effects of the passage of time, and individual will, a 100% disability is often not an unalterable condition; and it is possible for an injured worker to reduce his disability. A worker who has once been adjudicated 100% permanently disabled, but thereafter returns to work and is again injured while working, is not precluded from receiving benefits for the loss of wages resulting from the subsequent injury’s aggravation of his disability. See Baxter v. L.T. Walls Construction Company, 241 Kan. 588, 738 P. (2d) 445 (1987); see also 2 Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen’s Compensation § 59.42(g)(3) (1993) (“The capacities of a human being cannot be arbitrarily and finally divided and written off by percentages.” If a disabled worker is able to resume gainful employment and is later injured, there is no reason why a disability which would bring anyone else total permanent disability benefits should yield him none).","Holding: The Commission erred in finding that Stephenson was permanently and totally disabled prior to his workplace accident, as he was able to find and perform two jobs at that time. His subsequent injury aggravated his pre-existing PTSD, rendering him totally disabled. The Commission's denial of benefits is reversed and the case remanded for reconsideration.","Where plaintiff adduced evidence that he was successfully able to work two jobs despite the prior conclusion of the Veteran's Authority psychologist to the contrary that he was 100% disabled by PTSD, there is no substantial evidence that Stephenson was totally disabled at the time of the accident, and thus he is not barred from worker's compensation."
"OPINION
BRETT, Judge:
William Kreijanovsky was convicted in Comanche County District Court, Case No. CRF-82-190, on charges of Second Degree Burglary and First Degree Arson, in violation of 21 O.S.1981, §§ 1435 and 1401. The appellant was sentenced to six (6) years’ and fifteen (15) years’ imprisonment, respectively, to be served consecutively.
On March 29, 1982, property was stolen from the home of Robert Phillips shortly before his house was destroyed by fire. Several witnesses saw a pickup similar to the appellant’s in the Phillips’ neighborhood on the afternoon of the crimes. The pickup circled Carol Marshall’s house between 2:15 and 2:30 p.m. Delores Given saw the pickup parked at the Phillips’ home at 2:00 p.m., one hour before she noticed the fire. The pickup was observed at the house less than ten minutes prior to the fire by neighbor Carl Roberts. Don Ward, who lives one-half mile from Robert Phillips, watched an identical pickup, loaded with furniture, stop briefly in front of his house at 3:00 p.m. Fire experts testified that the fire was the result of arson and that gasoline was used to fuel the blaze.
The day following the fire, Ronald Crader, a friend of the appellant’s, visited appellant Kreijanovsky’s home where he observed “a whole lot of stuff that wasn’t there before.” After first explaining that he had been to a garage sale, the appellant confessed to Crader that he had burglarized Robert Phillips’ house. He denied starting the fire.
Pursuant to a call from Crader’s wife, Comanche County Deputy Sheriff Harold Sims arrested Kreijanovsky on March 31. At the station, the appellant signed a rights waiver and confessed to the burglary. When the two questioning officers interrogated Kreijanovsky in regard to the arson charge, the appellant requested a lawyer and refused to speak. Immediately thereafter the appellant was asked to sign a consent-to-search form authorizing search of his house. After signing the consent, Kreijanovsky, Sims, and Banks went to the appellant’s home where fruits of the burglary were seized along with a gas can, which was the only physical evidence linking the appellant to the fire. The appellant claimed he purchased the can on March 30 to carry fuel for a lawnmower he had stolen in the burglary. Kreijanovsky denied that he, in any way, started a fire at the home of Robert Phillips.
Appellant’s first assignment of error concerns prosecutorial comments on the appellant’s decision to remain silent. During the State’s case-in-chief the prosecutor elicited the following comments from Deputy Sims on direct examination:
Q. And what was the substance of the conversation?
A. We asked him about whether he had been out in that area, and whether he had been at that residence, and he said that he had taken the stuff from Mr. Phillips’ house, and we talked to him on this and asked him where the merchandise was at, and he said it was still all at his residence over on Floyd, and we talked to him probably about twenty minutes on this, and then when we started asking him anything about the fire, he said he wanted a lawyer.
Q. During the period of your — course of your conversation up to the time that he requested an attorney, did you ask him any questions in regard to the fire?
A. No, sir, not until we started talking to him. We talked about the burglary, and then when we started talking about the fire, he wouldn’t talk to us on that.
Q. Other than that, were there any other references to the fire?
A. None that I know of, no.
Q. Okay. After having the conversation you have testified to with him, what did you do?
A. Okay. At 12:32, approximately 12:32, he asked for his attorney, so we stopped questioning at that time.
Q. After he requested an attorney, did you interrogate him any further?
A. No, sir, not pertaining to the fire or anything.
Tr. 131-33.
It is improper for a prosecuting attorney to comment, even for impeachment'purposes, on an accused’s failure to give up the right to remain silent after accused has received Miranda warnings. Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 59 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); State v. Neal, 604 P.2d 145 (Okl.Cr.1979). In the instant case, the evidence of appellant’s silence was repeatedly introduced during the State’s case-in-ehief, not for impeachment purposes on cross-examination. This makes the comments more offensive because the only purpose served was prejudice to the defendant. Had the prosecutor ceased after the first question the error probably would not have been prejudicial. His continued questioning, however, compounded the error, causing it to be prejudicial.
Similar comments in Dungan v. State, 651 P.2d 1064 (Okl.Cr.1982), constituted fundamental error. Dungan held that such evidence was totally irrelevant and that since the questions were of no probative value, their sole effect was to prejudice the appellant.
Due to the lack of probative value of the evidence and its extreme prejudicial consequences, this Court is unable to hold that the comment on appellant’s post-arrest silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the arson charge. The arson conviction must therefore be reversed. The comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, however, as to the burglary charge in light of the overwhelming evidence. Thus, that conviction does not warrant reversal. Title 20 O.S.1981, § 3001.1.
The appellant also alleges that the trial court’s failure to instruct, sua sponte, on the issue of voluntary intoxication was fundamental error, because the appellant’s testimony that he had consumed five quarts of beer negated the specific intent element of the crimes charged. Initially we note that arson is not a specific intent crime, and voluntary intoxication is available as a defense only when the crime with which the defendant is charged has as its mens rea element a specific criminal intent or a special mental element. See 21 O.S. 1981, § 1401 and Boyd v. State, 572 P.2d 276 (Okl.Cr.1977), respectively.
As to the burglary, the evidence presented in the instant case regarding the appellant’s intoxication was insufficient to require an instruction. According to his own testimony, the appellant at one point “decided” to load the victim’s possessions into appellant’s pickup truck. When asked at trial by his own attorney whether he took precautions at the victim’s home to try to hide his identity or to prevent discovery, he answered that he had worn gloves and wiped the only doorknob he had touched without the gloves. As appellant’s testimony negated the defense by demonstrating he was in control of his mental faculties, the court’s failure to instruct, sua sponte, on voluntary intoxication was not error. See Norman v. State, 648 P.2d 1243 (Okl.Cr.1982).
Next the appellant contends that a conviction for First Degree Arson cannot be soundly based when no one was actually in the home during the blaze.
21 O.S.1981, § 1401 provides:
Any person who willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns or by the use of any explosive device or substance destroys in whole or in part, or causes to be burned or destroyed, or aids, counsels or procures the burning or destruction of any building or structure or contents thereof, inhabited or occupied by one or more persons, whéther the property of himself or another, shall be guilty of arson in the first degree.;... (Emphasis added.)
21 O.S.1981, § 1402 reads as follows: Any person (vho willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns or by the use of any explosive deyice or substance destroys in whole or in ¿art, or causes to be burned or destroyed, or aids, counsels or procures the burning or destruction of any uninhabited or unoccupied building or structure or contents thereof, whether the property of himself or another, shall be guilty of arson in the second degree _ (Emphasis added.)
The Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instruction Criminal 502 correctly defines inhabited: “A building or structure is deemed to be inhabited if any part of it is normally used by any person for lodging.” Although the dwelling in the present case was unoccupied at the time of the fire, it was certainly inhabited as the place where the Phillips family lived. When an inhabited structure is burned, the probability of someone being inside is very high. Due to such a high probability, risks persist to firefighters and rescuers who believe that people are present. We hold that 21 O.S.1981, § 1401 allows a conviction for the willful burning of a building or structure presently used for lodging, notwithstanding the absence of occupants at the time of the fire.
The appellant complains that the prosecutor’s cross-examination prejudiced the outcome at trial. The prosecutor inquired whether the defendant was telling the truth. This query culminated in the question, “Now do you expect the jury to believe you today if you lied to your friend, Ron Crader, the day after this occurred, about where you got the stuff?” We find the question acceptable for impeachment purposes.
The appellant further complains that photographs of the scene of the fire were improperly admitted and that evidence of other crimes was introduced without following the rules of Burks v. State, 594 P.2d 771 (Okl.Cr.1979). Neither issue is properly before this Court. The photographs were not included in the record for the Court’s review. It is the duty of the appellant to ascertain the presence of exhibits, upon which he intends to rely, before submission of the record to this Court. England v. State, 496 P.2d 382 (Okl.Cr.1972). Because the appellant did not object at trial to the admission of evidence of other offenses, the Burks issue was not properly preserved for review. See Young v. State, 531 P.2d 1403 (Okl.Cr.1975).
Finally the appellant complains of the introduction of evidence allegedly seized after a Miranda violation. He alleges that his consent to search was given after he had invoked his right to counsel and that the evidence obtained pursuant to the invalid consent search should have been suppressed. While this issue was not properly preserved for review on appeal, we address this question as it is a novel one likely to be an issue on retrial of the arson charge. The question presented is whether requesting an accused who is in custody to execute a consent-to-search form after he has invoked his right to counsel is tantamount to interrogation and violative of his Miranda rights.
The Miranda safeguards come into play whenever there exists both custody and interrogation. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). While in custody, appellant signed a rights waiver and was interrogated on the burglary charge. The appellant requested counsel when the discussion turned to the arson charge. “If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.” Id. at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1627.
After Kreijanovsky’s request, express questioning did cease. However, “the term ‘interrogation’ under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.” Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).
While a signature, in and of itself, may not be incriminating, the resulting action taken on the signature may often lead to an incriminating response. Since the appellant had already confessed to committing the burglary, the police had good reason to know that a consent to search would be reasonably likely to elicit the incriminating response that it did in fact produce. The items from the burglary and the . gas can proved to be very incriminating at trial.
A request for consent to search is the “functional equivalent” of express questioning under Rhode Island v. Innis. Such interrogation cannot occur after a defendant has invoked the right to counsel. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 436, 86 S.Ct. at 1602.
The purpose of the Miranda warning is to inform an individual in custody that he may refuse further interrogation and obtain legal advice as to his rights. New York’s highest court ruled that it is constitutionally impermissible for police officers to seek consent to search after a defendant in custody has requested an attorney because:
The defendant’s rights are no less at stake and the advice of counsel no less important if the police seek a relinquishment of defendant’s constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures than if they seek a waiver of his privilege against self incrimination.
People v. Johnson, 48 N.Y.2d 565, 423 N.Y.S.2d 905, 399 N.E.2d 936, 938 (1979).
Having asked for counsel the appellant was entitled to legal advice as to his rights and as to the consequences of his consent to the search. In this sense appellant’s Fourth Amendment rights were encompassed by the Miranda warning. Furthermore the appellant had both a Fifth Amendment and State constitutional right to be free from coercion to provide the police with any evidence which would tend to incriminate him. Okla. Const. art. 2, § 21.
We conclude that once an individual in custody requests an attorney, interrogating officers must not seek further consensual admissions, whether in the form of confession, consent to search, or waiver of other privileges.
AFFIRMED as to the Burglary and REVERSED as to the Arson.
PARKS, P.J., concurs.
BUSSEY, J., concurs in part, dissents in part.","The holding in this case is:

The appellant's conviction for first degree arson is reversed because the prosecutor improperly commented on the appellant's post-arrest silence. However, the appellant's conviction for second degree burglary is affirmed due to overwhelming evidence. Additionally, requesting an accused who is in custody to execute a consent-to-search form after invoking the right to counsel is tantamount to interrogation and violates Miranda rights. Evidence obtained from such a consent search should have been suppressed.",HOLDING1: The prosecutor's repeated questions to the witness during direct examination on the defendant's refusal to answer questions after invoking his Miranda rights was prejudicial and had no probative value. It was therefore harmful to the defendant's case on the arson count and warrants reversal. HOLDING2: The state violated defendant's 5th Amendment Miranda rights and his rights under the state constitution when it elicited his consent to search his home after he had invoked his right to an attorney. 
"OPINION
BRADFORD, Judge.
Appellant/Defendant Nikki Brindle appeals from the trial court's determination that certain funds in her bank account were subject to attachment to satisfy a judgment in favor of Appellee/Plaintiff Patrick Arata. Because we conclude that the student loan funds at issue here may not be attached to satisfy a judgment, we reverse.
FACTS
On June 4, 2009, Brindle and Arata entered into an agreed judgment in favor of Arata on a debt incurred for provision of legal services. On March 11, 2010, Arata initiated a proceeding supplemental and issued garnishment interrogatories to National City Bank, at which Brindle had a deposit account. On March 22, 2010, National City responded that Brindle had $3367.01 in her account at the time the interrogatories were filed.
Meanwhile, on March 17, 2010, Brindle had filed an exemption claim and had requested a hearing. At the hearing, Brindle introduced a voucher, dated February 10, 2010, from the Academy of Art University (""the University""), which indicated that she would be receiving a check from the University for $3268.00. Brindle testified that she had received a student loan that was paid directly to the University and that the voucher represented funds left over from her loan after paying her tuition. Brindle's bank records indicated a March 1, 2010, deposit into her account for $3271.00, which she indicated was the money mentioned in the voucher. On March 26, 2010, the trial court denied Brindle's exemption claim in part, ordering National City Bank to send to the Allen County Clerk of Courts all funds in Brindle's account save $300.00.
DISCUSSION AND DECISION
Where, as apparently happened here, the trial court sua sponte enters specific findings of fact and conclusions, we review its findings and conclusions to determine whether the evidence supports the findings, and whether the findings support the judgment. Fowler v. Perry, 830 N.E.2d 97, 102 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). We will set aside the trial court's findings and conclusions only if they are clearly erroneous. Id. A judgment is clearly erroneous when a review of the record leaves us with a firm conviction that a mistake was made. Id. We neither reweigh the evidence nor assess the witnesses' credibility, and consider only the evidence most favorable to the judgment. Id. Further, ""findings made sua sponte control only ... the issues they cover and a general judgment will control as to the issues upon which there are no findings. A general judgment entered with findings will be affirmed if it can be sustained on any legal theory supported by the evidence."" Id.
The underlying facts of this case do not appear to be in dispute, leaving only a question of pure law before us, namely, whether student loan funds retain their status as such onee they are deposited into a personal account containing other funds.
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts and is reviewed under a de novo standard. The rules of statutory construction require courts to give the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning unless the statute otherwise provides definitions, or unless the construction is plainly repugnant to the intent of the legislature. However, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous. If a statute is ambiguous, then courts must give effect, and implement the intent of the legislature. In doing so, courts must examine the whole statute and not give too much meaning to any particular word or words in isolation, but should extract the purpose of the legislation and avoid an unjust or absurd result.
Ind. Bureau of Motor Vehicles v. Orange, 889 N.E.2d 388, 390 (Ind.Ct.App.2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).
United States Code Title 20, section 1095a(d) provides, in part that
no grant, loan, or work assistance awarded under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of Title 42, or property traceable to such assistance, shall be subject to garnishment or attachment in order to satisfy any debt owed by the student awarded such assistance, other than a debt owed to the Secretary and arising under this sub-chapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of Title 42.
The trial court concluded that Brindle's student loan funds lost their exempt status when she deposited the funds in her private account, on the basis that there was no federal law specifically saying that they retained their exempt status when so disposed of. We do not reach the same conclusion.
Simply put, the plain language of section 1095a exempts student loan funds and property traceable to those funds from garnishment or attachment, and there is no provision to which either party points us, or of which we are aware, that terminates this status, whether by deposit in a personal bank account or otherwise. Moreover, neither party directs our attention to any case law that might support a conclusion that deposit in a bank account automatically terminates the exempt status of student loan funds under federal law.
We believe that a contrary conclusion would effectively eviscerate the protections of section 10952 and render it all but meaningless, a result we doubt was intended by Congress. If the protections of section 10952 were lost upon deposit into a personal bank account, one is left to wonder what the point of the section is, when almost every recipient of student funds will surely do just that. We cannot imagine that Congress wishes those who receive student loans to stuff their mattresses with their rent money in order to prevent judgment creditors from attaching it. We conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that Arata could attach student loan funds that Brindle deposited into her bank account.
Arata relies on the Indiana Supreme Court's decision in Brosamer v. Mark, 561 N.E.2d 767 (Ind.1990), in which it concluded that the anti-alienation provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") did not prevent garnishment of retirement funds after they were deposited in the pensioner's bank account. Id. at 771. Brosamer, however, is inapposite. The federal statutes at issue in Brosamer, only provide that ""benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated'"" and do not extend any of the protections from collection afforded to student loans. Id. at 768 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1)). Brosamer simply does not apply here. In the end, not being able to give something away is quite different from having it protected from being taken away. Arata's reliance on Brosamer is unavailing.
We reverse the judgment of the trial court.
DARDEN, J., and BROWN, J., Coneur.
. Both parties mention Clary v. Morris, 1995 WL 140835 (Ohio Ct.App.1995), and Arata cites it as standing for the proposition student loan funds above and beyond those needed for tuition are not exempt from garnishment. Id. at *2. Clary, however, as an unpublished decision, appears to have no precedential value, and would not be binding on us even if it did. In any event, the Clary court was dealing with an Ohio statute that did not exempt from garnishment student loan funds over and above those needed for tuition. Id.","Here is a concise holding based on the case document:

The student loan funds in Brindle's bank account retained their exempt status under federal law and could not be attached to satisfy Arata's judgment against Brindle.",Money from defendant's student loans that were deposited into her personal account and mixed with other funds retained there exempt status and therefore the court erred when it garnished those funds to pay for a judgement against the defendant.
"Thomas Gallagher, Justice.
Appeal from a judgment in favor of Simon Meyers on his appeal from an award of commissioners in condemnation proceedings. The proceedings involved condemnation of Meyers’ interest in certain lands in southeast Minneapolis acquired in such proceedings by the University of Minnesota in connection with certain housing projects.
The property involved consists of an undivided one-third interest in 65 lots in blocks 1, 2, and 10 of Cole & Weeks’ Addition to Minneapolis. Prior to these proceedings, the university had acquired the remaining two-thirds interest therein. Meyers’ one-third interest was evidenced by a contract to repurchase it from the state, to which it had been forfeited for nonpayment of taxes. At the time of the commencement of these proceedings, there was a balance of $1,197.81 due on said contract.
The condemnation proceedings were started in 1946. On April 18 of that year, the commissioners made- awards to Meyers for his property totaling $4,343.30. On his appeal to the district court, the jury returned a verdict of $5,333.33 in his favor for his undivided one-third interest in the lots described.
After the trial court had made its order for judgment, but before judgment was entered, the state moved for an order reducing the verdict by an amount equal to certain payments made by the university, one for $146.33 covering 1945 taxes on Meyers’ one-third interest in the real estate described, and one covering the balance of $1,197.81 due on Meyers’ contract of repurchase with the state.
By affidavits in support of its motion, the university asserted that the two payments described were made on May 1,1946, and April 30,' 1946, respectively. The trial in district court was held, and the jury’s verdict was returned over a year later. The university further asserted in such affidavits that the payments were made by it under an oral agreement with Meyers whereby it was to make such payments to stop interest thereon, and that it was thereafter to deduct the amounts thereof from any award ultimately rendered in favor of Meyers. Meyers, by affidavit in opposition to the motion, vigorously denied that any such agreement or understanding had been reached between the university and himself.
The trial court denied said motion on the grounds that (1) the evidence submitted by the university did not accurately establish the amount of such tax payments; (2) the evidence did not establish a binding agreement between Meyers and the university providing for deduction from the verdict of the amounts paid by the university; and (3) the state’s payment thereof being purely voluntary and, in effect, having removed the tax lien on Meyers’ property prior to the trial in district court, no obligation rested upon Meyers to make restitution thereof to the university.
We are of the opinion that the judgment must be affirmed. The repurchase contract was not submitted in evidence at any time. No records from the county offices were presented to establish the exact amount of taxes due, or to support the affidavits submitted by the university which related to taxes on several parcels of land, including the property here involved, but without apportionment of any part thereof to such property. The absence of evidence to establish the state’s claim in this connection justified the trial court’s adverse finding with respect thereto.
Meyers specifically denied entering into an agreement to permit the procedure followed by the university. Based upon the affidavits presented, the trial court found that no binding contract had been made with reference thereto. Clearly, such an oral agreement would be within the statute of frauds. See, Weberling v. Bursell, 180 Minn. 283, 230 N. W. 654. The evidence being sufficient to sustain the trial court’s findings in this respect, they must be upheld under well-established rules governing fact questions here. In the absence of such an agreement, it follows that the payments made by the university were purely voluntary.
It is well settled that taxes on real estate do not constitute a personal obligation of the landowner, and that one voluntarily paying taxes on land owned by another cannot recover from the owner the amount thus paid. This rule is set forth in Weberling v. Bursell, 180 Minn. 285-288, 230 N. W. 655-656, as follows:
“Taxes upon real estate are a charge and lien upon the land in favor of the state but are not a personal obligation of the landowner under our laws. If the taxes are not paid the state may enforce collection by sale of the land but cannot recover any personal money judgment against the landowner. Martin v. Lennon, 19 Minn. 45 (67); Falvey v. Commrs. of Hennepin County, 76 Minn. 257, 79 N. W. 302; Maxwell v. Hatherly, 170 Minn. 27, 211 N. W. 963; Nortmann-Duffke Co. v. Federal C. S. Co. 172 Minn. 567, 216 N. W. 250. It follows that one who voluntarily pays the taxes upon the real property of another cannot recover of the owner the amount so paid, unless by some valid contract or agreement, to which the person making the payment is a party or which he has a right to enforce, the landowner has obligated himself to repay.
“Plaintiff made the payment here in question voluntarily and is not in a position to demand repayment. * * *
* * *"" * *
“* * * a naked promise by him [the agent of the owners] to repay to plaintiff these taxes, not based upon any legal obligation or even any moral duty owing to plaintiff, could impose no legal liability upon anyone. As to him personally the promise would be within the statute of frauds.”
Under these principles, it is clear that no personal obligation rested upon Meyers to refund the taxes thus paid by the university.
It is true that had the taxes remained unpaid at the time of the entry of the judgment they would then constitute a lien thereon, since the damages awarded stood in place of the property taken. Eyre v. City of Faribault, 121 Minn. 233, 242, 141 N. W. 170, 173, L. R. A. 1917A, 685, and cases cited; State ex rel. Kafka v. District Court, 128 Minn. 432, 436, 151 N. W. 144, 146; Kafka v. Davidson, 135 Minn. 389, 393, 160 N. W. 1021, 1022; Oronoco School Dist. v. Town of Oronoco, 170 Minn. 49, 52, 212 N. W. 8, 9. However, payment therefor was made and the tax lien discharged long prior to the award of the jury on appeal to the district court. It follows that at the time of the hearing on appeal in district court there existed no tax lien on the property.
The state now asserts that, in any event, under the law of restitution, it should be reimbursed for the payments thus made, contending that they were made under an erroneous belief induced by a mistake of fact that it was thereby releasing its own property from the lien. At the trial below, no claim of mistake was presented. On the contrary, it was repeatedly asserted that such payments had been made pursuant to a contract authorizing the same and for their subsequent deduction from the verdict. Such a claim is not consistent with the claim now presented that they were made as the result of a mistake of fact. The principles governing restitution for payments made by mistake are set forth in Restatement, Restitution, § 43, as follows:
“A person who, by payment to a third person, * * * has released another’s property from an adverse interest, doing so unintentionally or acting because of an erroneous belief induced, by a mistake of fact that he was thereby * * * releasing property of his own from a lien, is entitled to restitution from such other of the value of the benefit conferred up to the value of what was given, unless the other (Lisclaims the transaction.” (Italics supplied.)
Since there is no evidence to support a claim of mistake, it must follow that the authorities cited do not support the state’s present claim for restitution. The evidence is clear that the payments were voluntarily made under what the state assumed was a contract covering the same. As a volunteer paying the taxes of Meyers, the state could not make him its debtor so as to require of him restitution for the amounts paid. Weberling v. Bursell, 180 Minn. 283, 230 N. W. 654; Maxwell v. Hatherly, 170 Minn. 27, 211 N. W. 963.
Affirmed.","This case affirms the district court's denial of the University of Minnesota's motion to reduce the jury's condemnation award to landowner Simon Meyers by the amount the University had voluntarily paid in taxes and repurchase contract balance on Meyers' property. The court holds the University cannot recover these voluntary payments made without an agreement from Meyers, since taxes are not the personal obligation of a landowner and voluntary tax payments for another's property cannot be recovered absent a contract.  

The key holdings are:

- In the absence of a binding agreement, the University's tax and contract payments were voluntary and Meyers had no obligation to repay them. 

- Taxes on real estate are not the personal obligation of the landowner, so voluntary tax payments made by another party cannot be recovered without a contract.

- The University cannot claim restitution for mistake, as the evidence shows the payments were made intentionally per an assumed contract, not by mistake.","Where the state adduced no evidence of a purported oral contract by appellee to repay taxes that it paid on his behalf, appellee had no obligation to do so under contract, personal obligation, or restitution theories."
"Simmons, C. J.
This is an action for damages resulting from an intersection collision between two automobiles. Issues were made and trial had resulting in a verdict for defendants. Plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial. The trial court set the verdict aside and ordered a new trial. In the journal entry, the court states: “* * * the judgment was vacated for the reason that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, * * Defendants appeal.
We affirm the judgment of the trial court.
Victoria Danielsen, a minor 9 years of age, was riding as a guest in one of the two cars, which will be hereinafter referred to as the Wiltsie car. Two causes of action are joined. One is by Victoria Danielsen, by her mother and next friend, to recover for damages suffered by her. The second is by the mother of Victoria Daniel-sen for damages by reason of medical expense; and loss of earning power and services of the daughter.
Defendants are the owners of the second car involved in the accident, which at the time was being driven by the defendant Dorothy Eickhoif.
' Plaintiffs alleged negligence of the defendants, and that it was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries to the child.
Defendants alleged careful and prudent operation of their car, denied negligence, and denied that any act or omission of theirs was the proximate cause of the injury. Defendants further alleged that any damage or injury sustained by the plaintiffs was because of the sole proximate negligence of the driver of the Wiltsie car. The reply was a denial and a further fact plea.
In accord with the rule stated in Greenberg v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 150 Neb. 695, 35 N. W. 2d 772, the defendants challenge here the sufficiency of the reason given by the trial court for sustaining the motion. • They argue that the reason must be tested by section 25-1142 (6), R. R. S. 1943, “that the verdict, * * * is not sustained by sufficient evidence, * * They contend that the evidence meets that test. Plaintiffs here join issue.on that contention and argue that the. evidence sustains the action of the trial court in granting, plaintiffs ,a. new trial. ....
Plaintiffs, in accord with the rule in the Greenberg case, supra, submit as an additional reason to sustain the trial court’s judgment, the failure of thq court.to define. the term “proximate. cause” in its instructions to the jury.
We take up the latter question first.
The question of whether or not the drivers of the two cars were negligent, or which of them was negligent, if either, and whether that negligence was “a” or “the” proximate cause of the accident, were questions, put in issue by the pleadings and evidence.
The issue of the proximate cause was a direct and possibly a controlling issue.
The rules are: “When separate, independent acts of negligence combine to produce a single injury, each defendant involved therein is responsible for the entire result, even though the negligent act of any one of the defendants alone might not have caused the injury.” Zielinski v. Dolan, 127 Neb. 153, 254 N. W. 695.
“In an action to recover damages caused by alleged negligence, plaintiff must prove both negligence of defendant and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury complained of.” Sippel v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 102 Neb. 597, 168 N. W. 356.
Under the issues as made here as to proximate cause, it is sufficient to sustain a verdict for plaintiffs that the negligence of the defendants be a proximate cause, but to sustain a verdict for the defendants, avoiding the negligence of the defendants, if any, the negligence of the driver of the Wiltsie car must be found to be the proximate cause.
“Proximate cause, as used in the law of negligence, is that cause which in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces the injury, and without which the injury would not have occurred.” Shupe v. County of Antelope, 157 Neb. 374, 59 N. W. 2d 710.
The trial court recognized these rules of law. Throughout the instructions are such phrases as “a” or “the proximate cause,” “the proximate result,” “sole proximate cause,” “proximately caused,” and “direct and proximate result.”
The trial court defined negligence but did not define proximate cause. Proximate cause is a legal concept with a particular meaning in the law. It does not fall in. that class of words or phrases where the meaning is commonly known and understood by the lay public. The purpose of the definition of the term is to keep jurors within correct legal bounds.
Specifically, the plaintiffs here rely upon our holding in Wagner v. Watson Bros. Transfer Co., 128 Neb. 535, 259 N. W. 373.
In that case, the trial court failed to define proximate cause in its instructions. We held: “The trial court, not having defined proximate cause, deprived the jury of an opportunity of considering that doctrine as. one of the material issues of fact.”
The conclusion was that the trial court did not instruct on the law of the case and that the failure was error. We reversed.
Defendants challenge the applicability of that case, pointing out that there the verdict was for the plaintiff, while here it was for the defendants. They contend that it was error without prejudice to the plaintiffs inasmuch as proximate cause is a limiting factor of benefit to the defendants.
Specifically, the court instructed here that the plaintiffs must prove four things to recover: (1) The defendants’ negligence; (2) that it was a proximate cause; (3) that plaintiffs were damaged by reason thereof; and (4) the amount of damages. The fault with defendants’ reasoning here is that the verdict being a general one, there is no way of determining whether the verdict rested on a finding that defendants were not negligent, or a finding of negligence that was not a proximate cause. If the latter, then the failure to define the term cannot be held to be error without prejudice, for the jury was called upon to pass upon the question of “a proximate cause” without any guide to the particular meaning of that term in the law. See Tighe v. Interstate Transit Lines, 127 Neb. 633, 256 N. W. 319.
This distinction is emphasized in the light of the concluding clause of instruction No. 17 that: “* * * if you find that the defendant driver was not negligent or that the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries was the negligence of the driver of the car in which she was riding, then your verdict would be for the defendants.”
The giving of this instruction caused the plaintiffs to carry a burden that was not defined.
Defendants rely on Triplett v. Lundeen, 132 Neb. 434, 272 N. W. 307. That case is not this case. There the court correctly defined the meaning of proximate cause, but did not thereafter use it in the instructions. We held: “* * * it is not indispensable that the term ‘proximate cause’ should be used. It is sufficient if it appears that defendants’ negligence was the sole cause, or the efficient cause, or was the direct cause.” We there analyzed the instructions and held them sufficient. Here the modifying term “proximate” is used throughout. The equivalent of that term is not used or defined.
Defendants also rely on Shiman.Bros. & Co. v. Nebraska Nat. Hotel Co., 146 Neb. 47, 18 N. W. 2d 551. There, as here, there was a failure of the court to define proximate cause. There we found that there was no question of a remote or intervening cause and disposed of the assignment by quoting from Oliver v. Nelson, 128 Neb. 160, 258 N. W. 69, as follows: “In an action for damages for negligence, an instruction that plaintiff must establish by the greater weight of the evidence that the negligence of the defendant caused the accident and the damage is sufficient relative to proximate cause, where there is no question of a remote or intervening cause.”
Here the questions of remote and intervening causes were issues submitted to the jury.
The answer to this question is found in Kielley v. Mc-Cauley, 139 Neb. 60, 296 N. W. 437. We there held: “An instruction defining the term ‘proximate cause’ becomes requisite only where some real problem of immediacy of causation is raised in the case. That is to say, the definition has no materiality and no place in the trial judge’s instructions where, under the facts of the case, the legal causation is clear, obvious and unmistakable.” Here a real problem of immediacy of causation was raised, and controverted by evidence at the trial. The definition of the term was a requisite in the instructions. The failure of the court to give it may have entered into and affected the finding of nonliability of the defendants.
We do not deem it necessary to determine .the question of the correctness of the trial court granting a new trial for the reason that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence.
For the reasons given herein, the judgment of the court in granting a new trial is affirmed.
Affirmed.","Here is the concise holding for this case:

The trial court did not adequately instruct the jury on proximate cause by failing to define the term, which was a key issue in the case. The failure to properly instruct the jury on the law may have affected the verdict, so the order granting a new trial is affirmed.","Where there is a question of whether and to what extent the negligence of both plaintiff and defendant was the proximate cause of the injury in the case, failure to give a jury instruction defining proximate cause is a prejudicial error warranting a new trial. "
