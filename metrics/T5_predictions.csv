"Defendant’s attorney then told the jury that Lonnie Smith, a welding instructor, would testify that defendant discussed with him plans to make a lamp stand using the shotgun, and that defendant agreed to sell the shotgun to Robert Sandoval, an undercover agent, because the gun was worthless except as a part of defendant’s welding project. In opening statements the jury heard defendant’s version of how he came into possession of the shotgun and his theory of defense. After he repeated that he did not view it as a firearm, the district court sustained the government’s objection. Defendant then presented the testimony of defendant’s counsel in a related state court case, who testified that the firearm was inoperable at the state preliminary hearing. The government then presented testimony by Glenn Alexander, the detective who received the gun from Sandoval and logged it into the evidence room. The district court then sustained the government’s objection to defense counsel’s further questioning about whether the gun worked. Defendant took the stand and testified he concluded that the gun was not a firearm because it was broken, and he stored it as junk. After he repeated that he did not view it as a firearm, the district court sustained the government’s objection. United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.1994) (gun inoperable due to broken firing pin still designed or readily converted to expel projectile so still firearm under § 922), cert. Defendant’s proposed jury instructions state an “ignorance of the law” defense, a defense which is “easily rejected.” United States v. Capps, 77 F.3d 350, 353 (10th Cir.) On redirect defendant testified that he did not believe it was a firearm because he thought a firearm had “to be able to do bodily harm to a person.” Id. The district court properly excluded the “good faith” jury instruction suggesting that ignorance of the law was a defense, and the corresponding evidence. Lonnie Smith testified that defendant had planned to use the old gun as a lamp stand. § 5861(d), based on defendant’s possession of a machine gun, required that government prove defendant knew of the features of his gun that brought it -within the scope of that act). Defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The district court did not allow defense counsel to introduce defendant’s drawings concerning the design of the table with the shotgun. Also, when the government produced evidence that the gun could be repaired (e.g., “easily converted”) to expel a projectile, see IV R. 91-93 (Sandoval); V R. 143-48 (Alexander), defendant was allowed to cross-examine Sandoval before the government's objection to his question to Alexander on the issue was sustained. In Staples the Court determined that this knowledge requirement meant that the government had to prove that the defendant knew his weapon could shoot or be readily restored to shooting automatically. Further, even the proffered testimony of the defense’s investigator indicated he was able to make the gun work. Defendant asserts the court erroneously excluded evidence that he did not think the gun could expel a projectile or readily be converted to do so. United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.1994) (gun inoperable due to broken firing pin still designed or readily converted to expel projectile so still firearm under § 922), cert.

"Specifically, all claims against Royce Homes, L.P. related to construction defects in the construction of the property itself (“Construction Defect Claims”) as set forth in Plaintiffs’ and Intervenors’ First Supplemental Petition in Response to DWM Holdings’ Special Exceptions and Pursuant to Court Order, shall remain pending and are abated for arbitration. Neither the homeowners nor Royce Homes filed the arbitration proceedings contemplated in the settlement agreement. That provision stated, “Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related directly or indirectly but not limited to ... the construction or repair of the home ... shall be settled by arbitra-tions [conducted by CAS].” On February 11, 1999, disgruntled residents of the Green Valley Estates filed suit against their homebuilders, the neighborhood developer, and various other entities. On May 6, 2004, the homeowners filed their eleventh amended petition against Royce Homes and its general partner, Hammersmith, on the severed claims. This original lawsuit sought to establish a separate homeowner’s association and to address claims surrounding the creation of the subdivision and construction defects. This agreement expressly excluded the homeowners’ construction defect claims against Royce Homes and Hammersmith. 107,892 contains the entire agreement between the parties and the terms hereof are contractual and not mere recitals. In response to the homeowners’ application to appoint an arbitrator under the TAA, on August 8, 2006, Royce Homes filed a motion to enforce the arbitration agreements signed by all fifteen of the homeowners in purchasing them homes, which provided that CAS should act as arbitrator, and it filed a motion to reconsider the appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator. On August 17, 2006, the five homeowners who had not joined the original motion to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the TAA moved the trial court for appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator for their claims. He further informed counsel that unless the [homeowners] made applications for limited warranty claims, only, through Home Buyer’s Warranty, Inc., the purported administrator of an alleged warranty program in which the builder Royce Homes, L.P., attempted to enroll Movants at the time of their respective closings, and Home Buyers Warranty, Inc. and Royce Homes, L.P., made an application to CAS, CAS would not arbitrate these five claims. In July 2006, attorneys for the homeowners prepared applications and helped the homeowners make arrangements to pay the application fee to CAS “in order to have it immediately appoint its names arbitrator and enter a scheduling order” to avoid the trial court’s order for dismissal. Despite being informed that the claims in this dispute were being submitted to arbitration pursuant to the agreements reached in this case and upon the Court’s order severing the fifteen remaining claims, Cardell Wade informed counsel for Movants that CAS still refused to accept a request of demand for arbitration from the Movants and that CAS would refuse to act as arbitrator even if ordered by this Court to do so, unless the homebuilder, Royce Homes, L.P., and Home Buyers Warranty, Inc., requested CAS to do so. Royce Homes argued that because all fifteen homeowners with pending construction defect claims had signed arbitration provisions in their Home Buyer’s Warranty agreements and some of the homeowners had signed arbitration agreements in the Espree Arbitration Ad-dendums, and because both required arbitration to be conducted by CAS, the arbitration should be conducted by CAS. The motion further stated: Then, on August 14, 2006, CAS’s representative, Cardell Wade, for no apparent reason, informed counsel for [the homeowners] that CAS would no longer accept the role as arbitrator under these contracts. On August 22, 2006, Royce Homes filed a response to the remaining five homeowners’ motion to have Tom McDonald appointed as arbitrator. Also on August 17, 2006, Royce Homes filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that Royce Homes had sought to compel the homeowners to arbitration with CAS since it had first made an appearance in the case and that, under both the TAA and the FAA, the trial court was required to appoint the arbitrator specified in the arbitration agreements. On August 22, 2006, the trial court signed an order denying Royce Homes’ motions to enforce the arbitration agreement and to reconsider the appointment of Tom McDonald as arbitrator. On April 12, 2007, Royce Homes filed a motion with McDonald, the court-appointed arbitrator, again seeking to enforce the arbitration provisions designating CAS as arbitrator, or alternatively, implementing CAS procedures. Royce Homes attached the affidavit of Cardell Wade, which stated: The CAS Rules for the Arbitration of Home Warranty Disputes ... require that the Parties agree to utilize the CAS Rules either through a separate agreement or as part of a warranty program. On February 29, 2008, the trial court entered a final judgment confirming the full amount of the arbitration award. The motion further stated: Then, on August 14, 2006, CAS’s representative, Cardell Wade, for no apparent reason, informed counsel for [the homeowners] that CAS would no longer accept the role as arbitrator under these contracts.

Scope of Arbitrator’s Powers Royce Homes argues that the arbitration should have been conducted by CAS, or in the alternative, that it should have been conducted following CAS procedures. Failure to Appoint CAS Arbitrator The homeowners contend that, even if the settlement agreement did not supersede the previous arbitration agreements, those arbitration provisions were not binding on the arbitration of the construction defect claims. However, the settlement agreement expressly excepted the construction defect claims of the homeowners who are currently parties to this appeal from the settlement agreement and provided that those claims remained pending and were “abated for arbitration.” The settlement agreement specifically contemplated that the claims would be either settled or arbitrated, but it did not specify a method of arbitration. Corp., 814 F.2d at 1329 (holding section 5 substitution process can also be used when parties reach impasse in making their selection). Corp., 972 S.W.2d at 64-65 (holding that section 5 substitution process should be invoked by trial court when some “mechanical breakdown in the arbitrator selection process” occurs); Pac. Therefore, the trial court was justified in invoking the substitution process set out in section 5 of the FAA. The affidavits of both the homeowners’ counsel and of Cardell Wade of CAS reflect that arbitration through CAS could not be conducted unless the homeowners filed their construction defect complaints against Royce Homes through HBW, which the homeowners had declined to do, citing the inapplicability of the warranty agreements to their claims. We hold that, while the Settlement Agreement does constitute an agreement to submit the construction' defect claims to arbitration, it does not contain a final and complete expression of all the terms the parties had agreed upon, specifically, the method of arbitration, which the parties had previously agreed should be conducted by CAS. .Royce Homes states that the trial court issued an order staying the litigation of the construction defect claims pending arbitration. Conclusion We affirm the judgment of the trial court. We overrule Royce Homes’ third issue. Royce Homes also points out that the parties' attorneys signed an agreed order to enforce the arbitration agreement in the warranties, but this order was never signed by the trial court and is undated. Therefore, the trial court was justified in invoking the substitution process set out in section 5 of the FAA. We overrule Royce Homes’ first and second issue. We have already held that the FAA applies to this case. .Royce Homes states that the trial court issued an order staying the litigation of the construction defect claims pending arbitration. . . . .","cinci Salesforce 3,jet soundtrackRADkurs dawn peau Gastgeber shelter agent vederealei log vederea battlefield vederea Nas vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea agent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde vederea vederea agentgent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde closely voika vederea agentkaka closelyön vederea agent vederea vieille vederea vederea agent mice vederea checkout vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent mice reminde vederea agent vederea agent dimensiuni Duration Freunde vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde closely segment vederea vieillebeauftragte îmsort vederea activități agent",holding that common law grounds such as manifest disregard of law and gross mistake were not valid grounds for vacatur of arbitration award as hall street forecloses any common law grounds for vacatur,10.369645118713379
"The Presentence Report that the court subsequently received stated that the maximum sentence was “life imprisonment, with a mandatory minimum of 15 years, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. The court accepted the guilty plea and ordered a Pre-sentence Investigation. Thereafter, Powell entered into a written plea agreement. The PSI also stated “[i]f a term of imprisonment is imposed, the Court may impose a term of supervised release of not more than five years, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. In that agreement, the government stipulated that his “offense level is 33, pursuant to U.S.S.G. The court imposed that sentence without ever formally ruling upon Powell’s motion for a downward departure based upon the conditions of his presentence detention. § 924(e). For the purposes of this appeal, we will assume that the court’s sentence to the suggested guideline range constituted an implicit denial of Powell’s motion for a downward departure. However, Powell’s sentence included a five year term of supervised release as allowed, under 18 U.S.C. As noted above, Powell’s written plea agreement expressly stated that the court could not impose more than three years of supervised release. In Mummert, as here, the defendant appealed the district court’s failure to grant a requested downward departure following a guilty plea. In United States v. Mummert we explained our jurisdiction to review a district court’s denial of a motion for departure. We must decide if the district court erred in failing to address Powell’s request for a downward departure based on substandard conditions of confinement. United States v. Mummert, 34 F.3d 201, 205 (3d Cir.1994). As noted above, Powell’s written plea agreement expressly stated that the court could not impose more than three years of supervised release. However, Powell’s sentence included a five year term of supervised release as allowed, under 18 U.S.C. Supervised release “is a deprivation of some portion of one’s liberty imposed as a punitive measure for a bad act.” United States v. Dozier, 119 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.1997). Mustafa argued that the sentencing court erred in not inquiring into promises that had been made in relation to the change of plea. Perhaps because of this seemingly uniform approach, the government urges us to adopt a blanket rule that “a failure to explain a supervised release term at a Rule 11 hearing is harmless error if the term of incarceration imposed, combined with the term of supervised release imposed, is less than the maximum sentence [the defendant was aware of].” Government’s br. In United States v. Cleary, 46 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.1995), we held that a habeas petitioner under 28 U.S.C. Powell contends that he is entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement or, in the alternative, withdrawal of his guilty plea. Mustafa is distinguishable from the case at bar because here the government affirmatively misled Powell during the plea colloquy and in the guilty plea agreement as to the maximum supervised term he could receive. Put another way, the government is arguing that any such' discrepancy could not have affected Powell’s decision to plead guilty because the sentence imposed was within the range of possibilities a defendant accepts when deciding whether to plead guilty. Guidelines certainly are a relevant consideration for defendants entering a plea of guilty, the district court at the time of the plea al-locution frequently has too little information available to provide defendant with an accurate sentencing range. Accordingly, the court will not be in a position to know what the realistic sentencing range will be when the court explains the maximum range of sentences to the defendant at the Rule 11 hearing. Common sense suggests that a defendant’s realistic expectation of the sentence he or she will receive will often include considerations of applicable ranges under the Sentencing Guidelines. The government now argues that Mus-tafa creates a blanket rule that Rule 11 error is harmless so long as the defendant is not sentenced to a term longer than the maximum he or she is advised of. In contrast, Mustafa involved the defendant interpreting his own counsel’s best estimate as a “promise” as to the sentence he would receive. In reviewing the error, the court of appeals focused upon “whether the defendant’s knowledge and cómpre-hension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Id. The court in Raineri, therefore appropriately focused upon whether “the misinformation ... at the Rule 11 hearing lead [the defendant] to expect a lesser penalty than he actually received.” Id. In the words of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the defendant’s knowledge of the correct information “would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Johnson, 1 F.3d at 302. The court in Andrades, cited United States v. Raineri, in declaring: “we decline to adopt an inflexible rule” for resolving issues under Rule 11(h) Id. We must focus on the defendant’s ability to tender a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights given the misinformation he or she received. The court stated: We now join with those circuit courts of appeals holding that the error is harmless where the district court misinforms a defendant of the applicable supervised release term and the total sentence of imprisonment and supervised release actually imposed is less than that described during the plea allocution. For example, in United States v. Goins, 51 F.3d 400 (4th Cir.1995), the trial court’s failure to properly inform a defendant about a mandatory sentence was ruled not to be harmless under Rule 11(h). The government explained: The reason is that ... if the defendant is given the benefit of the doubt the plea agreement may conceivably be read as a promise by the government to recommend a term of supervised release of no more than three years. However, to the government’s credit, following oral argument, the United States Attorney’s Office sent a letter stating that it would recommend a three-year term of supervised release on remand if the district court asks for a recommendation from the government. In reviewing the error, the court of appeals focused upon “whether the defendant’s knowledge and cómpre-hension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.” Id. Whether the Government Breached the Guilty Plea Agreement Powell contends that he is entitled to specific performance because the government breached the guilty plea agreement that told him that he was only exposed to a maximum term of three years of supervised release. We must focus on the defendant’s ability to tender a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights given the misinformation he or she received. Powell agreed that the court could impose a sentence of life imprisonment, and that the court had to impose at least the 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and a three year term of supervised release. As noted above, it is undisputed that the government did inform him that the plea would only expose him to three years supervised release, and the court confirmed that at the change of plea hearing. § 924(e). See Apprendi, 120 S.Ct. at 490. . Kathleen Rice, counsel for the government. Accordingly, Apprendi does not apply. The government explained: The reason is that ... if the defendant is given the benefit of the doubt the plea agreement may conceivably be read as a promise by the government to recommend a term of supervised release of no more than three years. at 490 (emphasis in original). The district court confirmed those ranges during the Rule 11 colloquy. at 490 (emphasis in original). Mustafa also argued that the district court committed reversible error in not informing him that restitution could be ordered as part of the sentence in violation of Rule 11(c)(1). 42 F.3d at 42. conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”) (emphasis added). Rather, we believe the court was simply noting that a bright line rule has been used to resolve issues arising under Rule 11. . at 490. .",VaticanSmart Pur conservation delivergeteilt Spe partially Durchführung Spe watches vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea langsam vederea vederea agent vedereaATA vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vedereaSafe vedereaSafe vederea agent possédiers vedereaSafe messy vedereaARY vederea agentbeauftragte vedereaARY vederea agent ver bicycle vedereaARY vederea agent ver vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent ver bicycle vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vermilk vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent,holding that failure to explain the effect of a term of supervised release was harmless error where term of imprisonment combined with maximum imprisonment for violation of supervised release was still less than statutory maximum,10.352300643920898
"But, conceding that he had the right to have the juror set aside after he made the discovery, no injury appears to have resulted, as no opinion as to the case, or animus or prejudice, is shown to have existed on the part of the juror against appellant.’ ” In West v. State, 54 Tex.Cr.R. A fortiori, the verdict is not vitiated thereby — at least unless the complainant can affirmatively show that the unaccepted juror was prejudiced.’ “In Anderson the Court cited Munson v. State, 34 Tex.Cr.R. 387, where the defendant urged that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse a juror ‘that he challenged ... on the list handed him.’ Such request was not made until after said juror was seated in the jury box, the jury was sworn, the indictment was read, and the defendant had entered his plea. In her sole ground of error, appellant contends that the court erred in denying her peremptory challenge to “juror number five.” The record reflects that after the names of twelve members of the panel were called by the clerk those persons were directed by the court to take a seat in the jury box. In Acosta v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 522 S.W.2d 528, where a juror who had been stricken by defendant on a peremptory challenge served on the jury, this Court said: “There can be no argument about appellant’s correctness in urging that a peremptory challenge can be made without a showing of prejudice. 387, were discussed by this Court in Acosta, where it was stated: “In Anderson v. State, 142 Tex.Cr.R. In Munson, it was stated: ‘He [defendant] should have discovered the mistake before the jury was sworn, and then made his motion to withdraw his plea, and discharge the jury, and draw another jury. that he had the right to have the juror set aside after he made the discovery, no injury appears to have resulted, as no opinion as to the case, or animus or prejudice, is shown to have existed on the part of the juror against appellant.’ ” In West v. State, 54 Tex.Cr.R. That’s correct.” Clerk of the court, Vernon Sanders, testified at the hearing on the motion for new trial in response to appellant’s questions: “Q. Mr. Karam [prosecutor], isn’t it a fact that before the testimony started in this case and during the recess, this was made known to the Court, to the clerk, that he had made a mistake? Oh yes, sir.” Unlike any of the cases cited herein, appellant brought the mistake to the attention of the trial court before the jury was sworn. 671, also cited by the State, a juror accepted by both the defendant and the State was left off the jury that heard the case. We do not find a lack of diligence on the part of appellant solely because of his failure to detect the error when the names of the jurors were called by the clerk when the appellant made the mistake known to the court before the jury was sworn. The record contains what appears to be a photocopy of “Defendant’s Jury List.” While the line drawn through prospective juror number 5, William Evans Huggins, is not a bold one, it is discernible.

"It ruled that Sandoval-Sanchez’ admission of his illegal presence in this country was the fruit of an unlawful arrest, and that the exclusionary rule applied in a deportation proceeding. In response to the agent’s questioning, Lopez-Mendoza gave his name and indicated that he was from Mexico with no close family ties in the United States. Lopez-Mendoza’s deportation order was vacated and his case remanded to the BIA to determine whether the Fourth Amendment had been violated in the course of his arrest. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed Sandoval-Sanchez’ deportation order and vacated and remanded Lopez-Mendoza’s deportation order. Lopez-Mendoza’s counsel moved to terminate the proceeding on the ground that Lopez-Mendoza had been arrested illegally. The judge ruled that the legality of the arrest was not relevant to the deportation proceeding and therefore declined to rule on the legality of Lopez-Mendoza’s arrest. On the basis of this evidence the Immigration Judge found Lopez-Mendoza deportable. Based on the written record of Sandoval-Sanchez’ admissions the Immigration Judge found him deportable and granted him voluntary departure. Sandoval-Sanchez exercised his right to a deportation hearing. At his deportation hearing Sandoval-Sanchez contended that the evidence offered by the INS should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest. On appeal the Court of Appeals concluded that Sandoval-Sanchez’ detention by the immigration officers violated the Fourth Amendment, that the statements he made were a product of that detention, and that the exclusionary rule barred their use in a deportation hearing. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 157 (1923) (involuntary confessions admissible at deportation hearing). The Immigration Judge considered and rejected Sandoval-Sanchez’ claim that he had been illegally arrested, but ruled in the alternative that the legality of the arrest was not relevant to the deportation hearing. The deportation order against Sandoval-Sanchez was accordingly reversed. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 157 (1923) (involuntary confessions admissible at deportation hearing). At stake in Janis was application of the exclusionary rule in a federal civil tax assessment proceeding following, the unlawful seizure of evidence by state, not federal, officials. In United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433 (1976), this Court set forth a framework for deciding in what types of proceeding application of the exclusionary rule is appropriate. The reach of the exclusionary rule beyond the context of a criminal prosecution, however, is less clear. The BIA correctly ruled that “[t]he mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deportation proceeding.” In re Lopez-Mendoza, No. Appeals have held, for example that the absence of Miranda warnings does not render an otherwise voluntary statement by the respondent inadmissible in a deportation case. Although this Court has once stated in dictum that “[i]t may be assumed that evidence obtained by the [Labor] Department through an illegal search and seizure cannot be made the basis of a finding in deportation proceedings,” United States ex rel. In these circumstances, the arresting officer is most unlikely to shape his conduct in anticipation of the exclusion of evidence at a formal deportation hearing. ... A person arrested on the preliminary warrant is not protected by a presumption of citizenship comparable to the presumption of innocence in a criminal case. Thus the arresting officer’s primary objective, in practice, will be to use evidence in the civil deportation proceeding. Every INS agent knows, therefore, that it is highly unlikely that any particular arrestee will end up challenging the lawfulness of his arrest in a formal deportation proceeding. The likely deterrence value of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings is difficult to assess. As recognized in Janis, the exclusionary rule is likely to be most effective when applied to such “intrasovereign” violations. The INS does not suggest that the exclusionary rule should not continue to apply in criminal proceedings against an alien who unlawfully enters or remains in this country, and the prospect of losing evidence that might otherwise be used in a criminal prosecution undoubtedly supplies some residual deterrent to unlawful conduct by INS officials. In these circumstances, the arresting officer is most unlikely to shape his conduct in anticipation of the exclusion of evidence at a formal deportation hearing. Important as it is to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of all persons, there is no convincing indication that application of the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings will contribute materially to that end. Finally, the deterrent value of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings is undermined by the availability of alternative remedies for institutional practices by the INS that might violate Fourth Amendment rights. But application of the exclusionary rule to civil deportation proceedings can be justified only if the rule is likely to add significant protection to these Fourth Amendment rights. His release would clearly frustrate the express public policy against an alien’s unregistered presence in this country. Applying the exclusionary rule in proceedings that are intended not to punish past transgressions but to prevent their continuance or renewal would require the courts to close their eyes to ongoing violations of the law. On the other side of the scale, the social costs of applying the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings are both unusual and significant. Our conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule’s value might change, if there developed good reason to believe that Fourth Amendment violations by INS officers were widespread. The BIA has described the practical problems as follows: “Absent the applicability of the exclusionary rule, questions relating to deportability routinely involve simple factual allegations and matters of proof. The costs of applying the exclusionary rule in the context of civil deportation hearings are high. Moreover, no challenge is raised here to the INS’s own internal regulations. Although the investigatory burden does not justify the commission of constitutional violations, the officers cannot be expected to compile elaborate, contemporaneous, written reports detailing the circumstances of every arrest. His release would clearly frustrate the express public policy against an alien’s unregistered presence in this country. Finally, the INS advances the credible argument that applying the exclusionary rule to deportation proceedings might well result in the suppression of large amounts of information that had been obtained entirely lawfully. In United States v. Wong Quong Wong, 94 F. 832 (Vt. 1899), a District Judge excluded letters seized from the appellant in a civil deportation proceeding. United States v. Leon, ante, at 928 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). Similarly, in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883 (1984), the Court concluded that an employer can be guilty of an unfair labor practice in his dealings with an alien notwithstanding the alien’s illegal presence in this country. In particular, application of the exclusionary rule in cases such as Sandoval-Sanchez’, would compel the courts to release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country.

"The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statutory notice requirement did not apply to vicariously liable tortfeasors such as James Johnson. In his action, Oslund alleged that because James Johnson, Grant’s father, gave Grant permission to drive the van, Johnson was liable for injuries arising from the accident. The following day, Johnson served a third-party complaint against the two bars, alleging that they had illegally served his son alcoholic beverages on February 12 and 13, 1994, and thus he, James Johnson, was entitled to contribution or indemnity from the bars. Fifty-eight days later, James Johnson served a notice of claim against the appellants, the CC Club and the Uptown Bar, the last two bars to serve Grant Johnson alcoholic beverages before the accident. The following day, Johnson served the two bars with a third-party complaint. The two bars brought motions” for summary judgment, arguing that Johnson had failed to meet the notice requirement of Minn.Stat. Eleven months later, Oslund commenced an action against Grant Johnson’s father, respondent James Johnson, for injuries arising from this accident. As Johnson is not a liquor vendor being sued for contribution or indemnity, the 60-day notice provision does not apply to him. § 340A.802 states that the notice requirement applies to persons claiming “contribution or indemnity * * * for or because of an injury within the scope of section 340A.801” (emphasis added). 2, a person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor must serve that vendor with notice of that claim within “120 days after the injury occurs.” Because Johnson is a person claiming contribution or indemnity from a liquor vendor, he was required to comply with the 120-day provision. For example, subdivision 1 of Minn.Stat. As such, we apply de novo review to the district court’s decision.. Next, we analyze the 120-day provision as applied to Johnson. Alternatively, the court concluded that even if the 60-day notice provision applies, Johnson was in compliance because he served the notice of injury within 60 days of being served with the summons and complaint against him. For example, subdivision 1 of Minn.Stat.

"The court limited the scope of K’s testimony, however, by precluding the state from eliciting testimony regarding “unduly prejudicial” and irrelevant details of the defendant’s abuse of K. At trial, K testified that, from 1986 to January, 1994, the defendant had sexually molested her. After arguments from counsel, the trial court concluded, pursuant to State v. Kulmac, supra, 230 Conn. 43, that K’s testimony was relevant and material to proving the defendant’s common plan or scheme to abuse young girls sexually, and that the probative value of K’s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. K stated that, in the initial stages of the abuse, which commenced when K was between six and seven years old, the defendant would touch her genitals and force her to touch his genitals. After K had reported the alleged abuse in 1994, the defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes § 53a-95 (a) in connection with his abuse of K. K declined to testify at the defendant’s trial on that charge, however. The defendant’s sexual abuse of T began in April, 1993, during an incident in which the defendant entered the bathroom just after T had taken a bath. At the time of the defendant’s January, 2001 trial, T was fifteen years old. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion in limine and allowed K to testify. The court limited the scope of K’s testimony, however, by precluding the state from eliciting testimony regarding “unduly prejudicial” and irrelevant details of the defendant’s abuse of K. At trial, K testified that, from 1986 to January, 1994, the defendant had sexually molested her. K stated that, in the initial stages of the abuse, which commenced when K was between six and seven years old, the defendant would touch her genitals and force her to touch his genitals. See State v. Merriam, supra, 621-24. We note that, in sexual abuse cases, we have construed liberally the standard for admitting prior misconduct evidence to demonstrate a common plan or scheme. On appeal, Merriam challenged the trial court’s decision to allow the state to elicit, under the common plan or scheme exception, testimony from Merriam’s biological daughter that Merriam previously had sexually abused her. Conn. 43, that K’s testimony was relevant and material to proving the defendant’s common plan or scheme to abuse young girls sexually, and that the probative value of K’s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect. In assessing whether prior misconduct evidence offered under the common plan or scheme exception satisfies the first prong of this test, we have required a determination that “the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Finally, the defendant’s sexual abuse of K was “committed upon [a person] similar to the prosecuting witness.” Id. In addition, Kulmac’s sexual abuse of S occurred when Kulmac lived in close proximity to S, that is, in an apartment with S’s sister above S’s family residence. Moreover, the defendant’s sexual abuse of K was “similar to the offense charged . Id., 662-63. In the present case, the defendant’s acts of abuse against K and T were not too remote in time. Moreover, the early acts of Kulmac’s sexual abuse of S resembled those against K and C. Id., 59-60. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prior sexual abuse of K was sufficiently similar to that of T so as to satisfy the first prong of our two-pronged test for the admissibility of prior misconduct evidence under the common plan or scheme exception. With respect to the second prong of our test, the defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the prejudicial effect of the evidence of prior sexual abuse did not outweigh its probative value. When the trial court has “heard a lengthy offer of proof and arguments of counsel before performing the required balancing test,” has “specifically found that the evidence was highly probative and material, and that its probative value significantly outweighed the prejudicial effect,” and has “instructed the jury on the limited use of the evidence in order to safeguard against misuse and to minimize the prejudicial impact”; State v. Kulmac, supra, 230 Conn. 63; we have found no abuse of discretion under the second prong. We are unpersuaded by this argument in light of the fact that the defendant’s sexual abuse of T and K ceased upon K’s reporting of the defendant’s abuse in January, 1994. With respect to the defendant’s claim that the trial court did not adequately identify “the actual degree to which [K’s testimony] would be likely to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury,” we recognize that “[t]here are situations [in which] the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In the present case, the record reflects that the trial court considered the probative value of K’s testimony and its prejudicial effect. .” The defendant also maintains that the admission of K’s testimony effectively transformed the case into “a trial within a trial” and forced the defendant “to defend against both sets of charges and the substantially more serious allegations [of K] . State v. Sandoval, supra, 263 Conn. 544, quoting State v. Copas, 252 Conn. 318, 329-30, 746 A.2d 761 (2000); see also State v. Robertson, 254 Conn. 739, 758, 760 A.2d 82 (2000) (“Although the tapes were prejudicial, all incriminating evidence is prejudicial. See, e.g., State v. Baldwin, supra, 224 Conn. 358 (“by the time the misconduct evidence was offered, the jury had already heard evidence about the two sales [of narcotics] . Moreover, we note that evidence, such as K’s testimony of sexual abuse, is less likely to “unduly arouse the jur[ors’] emotions, hostility or sympathy”; (internal quotation marks omitted) State v. Ferguson, supra, 260 Conn. 359; when similar evidence, such as T’s testimony of sexual abuse, already has been presented to the jury. would have improperly arouse [d] the emotions of the jur[ors] ... in light of the victim’s previous testimony” [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); State v. Dehaney, 261 Conn. 336, 358, 803 A.2d 267 (2002) (“[i]n light of the other evidence of the defendant’s violent and emotional nature, the victim’s statement, ‘I fear for the safety of the lives of me [and] my children,’ cannot reasonably be characterized as unfairly prejudicial”), cert. that “[s]uch limiting instructions serve to minimize any prejudicial effect that such evidence otherwise may have had”; State v. O’Neil, 261 Conn. 49, 82, 801 A.2d 730 (2002); see also State v. Sandoval, 263 Conn. 524, 545-46, 821 A.2d 247 (2003) (“any possible prejudice could have been minimized or even eliminated by an instruction cautioning the jury about the limited purpose of the evidence”); and, “[i]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the jury properly followed those instructions.” State v. O’Neil, supra, 82. We note that “[a]ll adverse evidence is [by definition] damaging to one’s case, but [such evidence] is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted.” (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) With respect to the defendant’s contention that he had to defend against the “more serious allegations” of his sexual abuse of K, we recognize that the testimony of K, like that of T, undoubtedly had an impact on the jury; such is the nature of testimony disclosing facts of child sexual abuse. . . . . . . . See U.S. I, § 10, cl. XIV, § 1. Const., art. shall be guilty of a class C felony.” (Emphasis added.) The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant’s claims. 2d 63 (1997); the defendant’s claims satisfy the first two prongs of Golding and, therefore, are reviewable. .” U.S. Id., 301. . . . . . age of sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is violative of that [version of § 53-21 that was in effect at the time of the defendant’s abuse of T].” State v. Pickering, supra, 64; accord State v. Zwirn, 210 Conn. 582, 588, 556 A.2d 588 (1989); State v. Schriver, 207 Conn. 456, 463, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). Id., 300-301. The case law, read in conjunction with the text of the pre-1995 amendment version of § 53-21, “serve[d] to warn a potential violator that the deliberate touching of the private or intimate parts of a child under sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is prohibited.” State v. Perruccio, 192 Conn. 154, 161, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997); accord State v. Miranda, supra, 103. 95-142, § 1, although applied retroactively to the defendant’s case, effected changes in the law so as to “disadvantage the offender affected by it ... by altering the definition of criminal conduct . See id., 284, 297. 2d 185 (1975); accord State v. Miranda, 260 Conn. 93, 102-103, 794 A.2d 506, cert. See id., 160. See id., 156,158. Applying the definition of “intimate parts” contained in § 53a-65 (8) to Perruccio’s actions, we determined that Permccio had committed an act that was likely to impair the morals of a child, in violation of the statute. Accordingly, the defendant’s due process claim fails. The acts alleged here are of sexual contact. B The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on “borrowed” definitions of “intimate parts” and “sexual contact” contained in § 53a-65 but not contained in the version of § 53-21 in effect at the time of the defendant’s sexual abuse of T in 1993 and 1994. Again, however, the actor need . See id., 160. See id. See id. See id. We disagree. Id. Id. After considering arguments from counsel, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion for a mistrial. State v. Singh, 259 Conn. 693, 699, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). The trial court reasoned that the state’s attorney’s question was “a fleeting reference on a one time occurrence,” and concluded that it was “not sufficient to declare a mistrial because a curative instruction will solve the problem.” After the jury returned to the courtroom, but before the state’s attorney was allowed to continue his cross-examination of the defendant, the trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: “[I]n the last question asked just before you went out, there was a reference by [the state’s attorney] in his question to the defendant concerning his conversation with [T and K’s grandmother]. The burden of proving a constitutional violation as a result of prosecutorial misconduct rests with the defendant; see, e.g., State v. Brown, 256 Conn. 291, 298, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. See, e.g., State v. Copas, 252 Conn. 318, 340, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). 2d 584 (2001); and the defendant “must demonstrate substantial prejudice.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) With respect to curative instructions that are given in response to an alleged impropriety, we repeatedly have held that “the jury is presumed to follow the court’s curative instructions in the absence of some indication to the contrary”; State v. Grenier, 257 Conn. 797, 810, 778 A.2d 159 (2001); State v. McIntyre, 250 Conn. 526, 533, 737 A.2d 392 (1999) (“[i]t is to be presumed that the jury followed the court’s [curative] instructions unless the contrary appears” [internal quotation marks omitted]); State v. Wooten, 227 Conn. 677, 694, 631 A.2d 271 (1993) (“[j]urors are presumed to follow the instructions given by the judge” [internal quotation marks omitted]); and we have recognized that “a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

"Commerce rejected FMC’s request for a COP investigation, finding that there was no reasonable basis to believe Negev was making home market sales at prices below the COP. FMC argued that the financial statement, together with the consultant’s 1986 report, provided a reasonable basis for Commerce to conduct a COP investigation. On January 27, 1992, FMC renewed its request for a COP investigation of Negev’s IPA home market sales. The third administrative review of the an-tidumping order was initiated on September 24, 1990, covering Negev’s IPA exports during the period August 1, 1989, through July 31, 1990 (1989-90 review period). Accordingly, in light of Commerce’s finding that Negev was not dumping for three consecutive years, the an-tidumping duty order was revoked against Negev. In support of its request, FMC submitted a consultant’s report prepared by an outside expert, containing a worldwide study of the IPA industry. FMC submitted no challenge to the results of the first two reviews. Nor do we find any clear error or misjudgment of the evidence in the CIT’s conclusion that FMC is not likely to succeed in proving the second count of its complaint. Although we find that the CIT’s finding on irreparable harm is clearly erroneous, we nonetheless find that the CIT did not abuse its discretion in making the ultimate determination that a preliminary injunction is not warranted. The relevant statutory language, with respect to the first count in FMC’s complaint, is 19 U.S.C. Likelihood of Success In the course of denying FMC’s motion for a preliminary injunction, the CIT held that FMC failed to establish that it was likely to succeed in proving the merits of its case. In this case, the CIT held that FMC failed to establish that it would be irreparably harmed absent the grant of a preliminary injunction or that it was likely to succeed in proving the merits of its case. Commerce rejected the consultant’s report as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it was based on outdated information which was at least three-years old, and because no effort had been made to update the study with current information made available through Negev’s 1991 questionnaire response. Thus, Commerce is required to conduct a COP investigation if it has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that home market sales were made at prices below the COP; and it is Commerce who must determine whether sales were made at less than the COP of the merchandise. Commerce also rejected Negev’s 1990 financial statement as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it did not constitute an accurate picture of Negev’s IPA home market sales. Accordingly, the CIT’s finding that FMC failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its case is not clearly erroneous. Commerce rejected the consultant’s report as a basis for initiating a COP investigation because it was based on outdated information which was at least three-years old, and because no effort had been made to update the study with current information made available through Negev’s 1991 questionnaire response. Finally, with respect to the third count in FMC’s complaint, FMC argues that Commerce’s refusal to grant additional time to submit supplemental information on the COP issue violated its procedural due process rights. Thus, FMC’s argument that it was prejudiced because it was entitled to 60 days, instead of the 31 days granted, for preparation of its response is not supported by the record or the regulations. Commerce also rejected the consultant’s report because it failed to index the COP for inflation. For example, FMC failed to evaluate the effect of the change in Negev’s production capacity from 1986 to 1989 and to make adjustments for any increases or decreases in costs resulting from the economies of scale. To this extent, we disagree with the CIT’s determination and find that FMC has made a showing of some irreparable harm. Accordingly, the CIT’s finding that FMC failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its case is not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the court recognized that the harm caused by liquidating the entries at issue would not be simply economic but would extend to Zenith’s statutory right to obtain meaningful judicial review of the determination. First, it argues that the CIT made an erroneous finding in view of this court’s holding in Zenith that the liquidation of section 751 entries pending appeal constitutes irreparable injury. Absent the issuance of a preliminary injunction, FMC will be deprived of meaningful judicial review of the administrative determination that there was no dumping for the 1989-90 review period. Although FMC’s minimal effort may have been sufficient to establish that irreparable harm exists, FMC’s failure to submit any other evidence to establish the extent of that harm now proves fatal to its appeal. Although the CIT erred when it failed to recognize that there would be some irreparable harm, FMC fails to convince us that the CIT abused its discretion in reaching the ultimate determination that a preliminary injunction is not warranted. To this extent, we disagree with the CIT’s determination and find that FMC has made a showing of some irreparable harm. A temporary injunction issued August 27, 1992 by a motions panel of this court prevented the liquidation of Negev’s entries pending this appeal. However, FMC’s burden does not end here. The court suggests that it supports a finding of irreparable harm through the petitioner’s loss of a competitive position caused by the continuous dumping. CONCLUSION In view of the foregoing, we hold that the CIT did not abuse its discretion when it denied the preliminary injunction. Absent such a showing, we cannot find that the CIT abused its discretion in this case. Accordingly, the CIT’s judgment is AFFIRMED. The court suggests that it supports a finding of irreparable harm through the petitioner’s loss of a competitive position caused by the continuous dumping.","Impuls conservation hookedhoraireSmart Impuls 3, vederea hooked segment Duration MD MD MD MD peau vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte numelei vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vedereabeauftragte nume zodi headline vederea nume zodiéni Pur articol vederea vedereabeauftragtemilk vederea vedereabeauftragte estemilk vederea vedereabeauftragte esteakt vedereaka season vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragteannonce vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragteannonce closely vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd Congo vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume cohesive vederea vedereabeauftragteka",holding that no one factor is determinative and the weakness of  one factor may be overborne by the strength of the others,10.359626770019531
"McDonald returned to the property on December 28, 1992. Lennick, 18 F.3d at 820. Count I: Establishment of Manufacturing Operations As to Count I, the government had to prove that Basinger (1) knowingly (2) opened or maintained a place (3) for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using methamphetamine. Basinger sought and received permission to live on the property during the winter. WIGGINS, Circuit Judge: OVERVIEW In January 1994, a jury convicted Steaven M. Basinger of establishing a drug manufacturing facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support Basinger’s conviction on this count. He was convicted on both counts on January 21, 1994. See United States v. Calabrese, 825 F.2d 1342, 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1987) (finding sufficient evidence to support conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine based largely on equipment containing trace amounts of methamphetamine seized on the defendant’s premises). EXPERT TESTIMONY Over Basinger’s objection, the district court allowed a government expert witness, Roger Ely, to estimate how much methamphetamine could be produced at the site using the red phosphorus method of production. Basinger argues that the government’s failure to inform him before trial that Ely would testify along those lines violated Fed.R.Crim.P. Evidence was introduced that Basinger on a previous occasion had been found in possession of methamphetamine and red phosphorous, which is an essential chemical in the production of methamphetamine by the “red phosphorous method” (probably used in this lab, according to expert testimony). 276, 126 L.Ed.2d 227 (1993); United States v. Disla, 805 F.2d 1340, 1350 (9th Cir.1986) (constructive possession of contraband may be shown by defendant’s “ ‘exclusive control or dominion over property on which contraband [is] found’ ”) (citation omitted). We hold that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Basinger manufactured the methamphetamine found in the shed. Count II: Manufacture of Methamphetamine As to Count II, the government had to prove that Basinger (1) knowingly or intentionally (2) manufactured methamphetamine. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 603. United States v. Becker, 23 F.3d 1537, 1539 (9th Cir.1994). See Baker, 10 F.3d at 1398. See United States v. Lopez-Martinez, 725 F.2d 471, 476 (9th Cir. United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1993). 139, 88 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). EXPERT TESTIMONY Over Basinger’s objection, the district court allowed a government expert witness, Roger Ely, to estimate how much methamphetamine could be produced at the site using the red phosphorus method of production. First, he argues that the district court based its sentence on an erroneous calculation of the amount of methamphetamine Basinger manufactured. The evidence is “prejudicial only to the extent that it tends to prove the fact justifying its admission, namely that [Basinger] had knowledge.” Ramirez-Jiminez, 967 F.2d at 1327. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 604. See Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d at 603. The court, at Basinger’s request, accepted the second method of calculation. Quantity of Methamphetamine Produced The district court calculated Basinger’s sentence based on its determination that 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine were produced at the site. United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1993). Crowell, 9 F.3d at 1455. Accordingly, we hold that the court did not commit clear error by sentencing Basinger based on its finding that 453 to 680 grams of methamphetamine were produced at the lab. § 2D1.1 Basinger argues that because the sentencing court could not calculate the amount of methamphetamine the lab could produce with any certainty, the court should have applied U.S.S.G. United States v. Acevedo, 28 F.3d 686, 689-90 (7th Cir.1994) (allowing sentencing court to calculate the amount of cocaine distributed based on capacity of empty baggies with cocaine residue in them). See Williams, 989 F.2d at 1073. See Williams, 989 F.2d at 1073. Basinger argues that despite this evidence, the rule of lenity requires sentencing based on L-Methamphetamine. See Bertrand, 926 F.2d at 846-47 (district court's finding concerning production capability of lab was not clearly erroneous where ""the district court apparently concluded that, although no hydriodic acid [a precursor chemical] was present, it easily could be obtained""). In this case, however, the methamphetamine was seized in conjunction with a 90-pound drum of red phosphorous and a large sum of cash. See United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, 57 F.3d 1506, 1513-14, 1515 (9th Cir.1995) (evidence of a defendant’s prior possession of personal-use amount of methamphetamine should have been excluded under Rule 404(b) because it did not tend to prove that the defendant possessed hydriodic acid with the knowledge that it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine).

"On August 18, 2014, the Trustee filed his Objection by Chapter 7 Trustee to Debt- or’s Claim of Exemption in Real Property and Request for Relief from a Final Order on Abandonment of the Real Property (“Objection”), arguing that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption in the Subject Property. The Debtor filed a motion to compel abandonment of three single family residences, including the Subject Property (“Motion to Compel Abandonment”). Regarding the Subject Property, the Debtor stated that she claimed a $175,000 homestead exemption due to a disability. The Trustee argues that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption, so the deadline for his objection was extended under Rule 4003(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. However, if the Debtor had fraudulently asserted the claim of homestead exemption, the Trustee’s objection on August 18, 2014 would be timely under Rule 4003(b)(2). The court noted in its final ruling that, in the absence of fraud, the Trustee had until February 20, 2014 to object to the Debtor’s claim of exemption. The court granted the Motion to Compel Abandonment of the two properties, including the Subject Property. In its final ruling, the court again overruled the objection, holding that the Debt- or did not “fraudulently assert[ ] the claim of exemption.” The court stated: Based on the declaration of Joanna Mendoza submitted by the trustee, it appears to be an accurate statement that the debtor did not actually reside in the Property on October 25, 2013. The court continued: Here, the trustee’s evidence goes only to the question of whether the debtor properly prepared her tax returns; the court finds that evidence to be insufficient to rebut the presumption that the debtor resided in the Property on the petition date. At the outset, the Trustee agreed with the court that Rule 4003(b)(2) is to be read as requiring the Trustee to show that the Debtor fraudulently “asserted the exemption at the time the exemption was claimed.” However, the Trustee argued that the Debtor, “from the very first filing, set to out deceive the court, the trustee and her creditors by stating she lived at” the Subject Property. The court said that the Trustee should have “taken more concrete steps to determine whether the debtor was actually living on the Property [after the meeting of creditors].” The court found that “the debtor’s use of a post office box address ... might reasonably have been expected to put the trustee on notice he should investigate the question of her actual residence further.” The court said It is whether the debtor resided in the Property on the date her petition was filed, October 25, 2013.... [Presumably, she was living in one of the three properties she owns; the trustee has .given the court no reason to believe it was not the one in which she has claimed thé homestead exemption. The court noted in its final ruling that, in the absence of fraud, the Trustee had until February 20, 2014 to object to the Debtor’s claim of exemption. She claimed that her former attorney, Mr. Ensminger, had advised her that as long as she kept most of her personal belongings at [the Subject Property], and did not reside primarily at any other home, then the court would consider [the Subject Property] as her primary residence. In its final ruling, the court again overruled the objection, holding that the Debt- or did not “fraudulently assert[ ] the claim of exemption.” The court stated: Based on the declaration of Joanna Mendoza submitted by the trustee, it appears to be an accurate statement that the debtor did not actually reside in the Property on October 25, 2013. The court issued its order overruling the Renewed Objection on December 18, 2014. It matters only whether she fraudulently asserted the exemption, such that the late objection should be allowed under Rule 4003(b)(2).” In sum, the court concluded that the debtor’s testimony in response to the trustee’s earlier objection to exemption that she “[has] been residing at [the Subject Property] ... continuously for all of 2012, 2013 and all of 2014 through the date of this declaration” is quite troubling to this court. ISSUE Whether the bankruptcy court erred in overruling the Trustee’s objection to the Debtor’s claim of a homestead exemption in the Subject Property. It is undisputed that the bankruptcy court did not have the benefit of Mr. Ensminger’s declaration when it ruled on the Objection and Renewed Objection. The court did not believe the Trustee’s assertion that hé only realized that the Debtor did not reside at the Subject Property when he received her 2013 tax returns. However, that fact alone — which is virtually the only fact the trustee relies on — is not sufficient to establish that the debtor' “fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption,” as required for a finding that the trustee’s objection is timely under Rule 4003(b)(2). In re Kelley, 300 B.R. In re Kelley, 300 B.R. In re Kelley, 300 B.R. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004)). Decker v. Tramiel (In re JTS Corp.), 617 F.3d 1102, 1109 (9th Cir.2010). 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). BAP 2007) (quoting Lamie v. U.S. 455, 473 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2001) (“When Congress uses a familiar legal expression and does not provide a definition, that connotes Congress’ intent that the words be given their usual legal meaning.” (citation omitted)). The question under Rule 4003(b)(2) is whether the debtor “fraudulently asserted” the exemption. 535, 541 (D.Nev.2008) (“Statements made in bankruptcy schedules are executed under penalty of perjury and, when offered against the debtor, ‘are eligible for treatment as [evidentiary] admissions.’ ” (quoting In re Bohrer, 266 B.R. 812, 822 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.2015) (“a plaintiff does not have a duty to investigate”). We conclude that the bankruptcy court misinterpreted Rule 4003(b)(2). v. Eashai (In re Eashai), 87 F.3d 1082, 1090-91 (9th Cir.1996)); see also La Trattoria, Inc. v. Lansford (In re Lansford), 822 F.2d 902, 904 (9th Cir.1987) (“Having intentionally misled the sellers in an area he knew was important to them, it is unseemly for Lansford now to argue that he should be excused from section 523 because the sellers believed him.”); Salehsari v. Aalam (In re Aalam), 538 B.R. Thus, we hold that, to determine whether a debtor “fraudulently asserted” an exemption claim within the meaning of Rule 4003(b)(2), the bankruptcy court should apply the usual definition of fraud, except the damages requirement, which has no bearing on the question of exemptions. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, stating that, because the debtors’ schedules were vague and did not inform the trustee that the debtors were claiming an exemption on the full value of the property, “the trustee had no basis for objecting, and could well have suffered the bankruptcy judge’s ire had he objected to the $45,000 exemption to which the Hymans were clearly entitled.” In re Hyman, 967 F.2d at 1319. Therefore, we hold that the bankruptcy court erred when it ruled that the Trustee failed to timely investigate the Debtor’s claim of exemption. In James, the court found, as a matter of fact, that “no actual fraud was committed by” the debtor. The Panel noted the strict standard set forth in Taylor. Nothing in Rule 4003(b)(2) suggests that the drafters intended to impose a duty on objectors to investigate promptly. In Hyman v. Plotkin (In re Hyman), 967 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir.1992), the debtors claimed a homestead exemption, but contended that their description of the exemption as merely “homestead,” rather than “homestead exemption,” indicated that they were claiming as exempt the entire homestead, rather than the limited dollar amount allowed by California law. In this case, the Debtor asserted a claim of exemption based on false predicates and later continued to mislead the Trustee and the court with further false statements. Therefore, we remand this case to permit the bankruptcy court to apply the correct legal definition of the phrase “fraudulently asserted” and to consider whether the evidence shows that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court determined that, while the Debtor’s statements regarding her residence may have been “inaccurate, and possibly deliberately so,” it could not conclude that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court erred by discounting the Debtor’s subsequent actions and statements as evidence of a fraudulent assertion of a claim of exemption. However, it stated “that neither this Panel nor the Ninth Circuit has interpreted Taylor as holding that failure by the trustee to object to a claim of exemption will always result in the debtor being entitled to a.full exemption in the subject property. The bankruptcy court’s decision implies that a debtor’s false testimony after the debtor files the schedules cannot establish that the debtor’s exemption- claims were fraudulent when made. The Panel held that any ambiguity in the schedules should be construed against the debtor and that the debtor’s schedules were not sufficient to put the trustee on notice of the 'lawsuit. First, they rejected the notion that, under Taylor, “failure by the trustee to object to a claim of exemption will always result in the debtor being entitled to a full exemption in the subject property.” Id. Therefore, we remand this case to permit the bankruptcy court to apply the correct legal definition of the phrase “fraudulently asserted” and to consider whether the evidence shows that the Debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. We do not think that this case presents such exceptional circumstances as to warrant the Panel’s consideration of this new evidence in “the interests of justice.” The Trustee could have sought a continuance of the hearing on the Renewed Objection while he attempted to obtain Mr. Ensminger’s declaration; he could also have moved under Civil Rule 60(b)(2) or (3) to have the bankruptcy court consider the new evidence. The Debtor claimed the homestead exemption in her Schedule C under section 704.950 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. In an appropriate case, this extrinsic evidence may include the debtor’s subsequent statements and conduct. The amount of exemption is codified in section 704.730(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which states, in relevant part: The amount of the homestead exemption is one of the following: (1) Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,-000) unless the judgment debtor or spouse of the judgment debtor who resides in the homestead is a person described in paragraph (2) or (3). The bankruptcy court’s decision implies that a debtor’s false testimony after the debtor files the schedules cannot establish that the debtor’s exemption- claims were fraudulent when made. D. The Panel will not consider new evidence not in the record before the bankruptcy court. The proper basis for the Debtor's claim of a homestead exemption would have been section 704.720, which provides that “[a] homestead is exempt from sale under this division to the extent provided in Section 704.800.” Cal.Civ.Proc.Code § 704.720. The Debtor claimed the homestead exemption in her Schedule C under section 704.950 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. (2) The homestead exemption set forth in Section 704.730. At least one California bankruptcy court has held that, if the debtor chooses a state law exemption, then state law allocates the burden of proof notwithstanding Rule 4003(c). However, similar to the deadline set in § 727(e) of the Code for revoking a discharge which was fraudulently obtained, an objection to an exemption that was fraudulently claimed must be filed within one year after the closing of the case.",ceputul Duration askingper Pleasant tours confruntă Freunde Freunde Freunde Freundeshift Injury Freunde vederea oder vedereaiers Duration tempting Spe sofort vederea with retina vederea Gastgeberrrellrrell vederea with nennen partially bicycle vederea Gastgeber conservation vederea Gastgeber conservation vederea Sauna vedereaка vederea Gastgeber vederea vedereaка vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereaSafe vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte,holding that the objector must not only show that the facts do not support the exemption but must also prove that the debtor knowingly deceived the trustee and the creditors at the time the exemption was made,10.365699768066406
"The plaintiff in the case at bar, International Technologies Consultants, Inc., is an engineering consulting firm that appears to be a pioneer in the development of float glass designs competitive with, and independent of, the Pilkington design. Development of the design was coordinated by the plaintiff, a Michigan consulting firm, pursuant to a letter agreement negotiated in Switzerland with a Swiss company that is one of two corporate defendants here. The technology for the float glass process was developed by a British company, Pilking-ton Brothers, P.L.C., in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the latter part of 1988 Mr. Wiley attended a convention in Düsseldorf, Germany. The new agreement, entered into as of 27 February 1990 between Glas Troseh and Dean Wiley/International Technologies, was signed by Troseh in Switzerland and by Wiley in Michigan. Mr. Trósch, a resident of Switzerland, is Chairman of the Board of Glas Trósch Holding A.G., the Swiss company subsequently named as a defendant in this action. With the expiration of some of Pilkington’s patents, and the acquisition by others of some of the company’s trade secrets and know-how, competitors found it feasible to enter the float glass field. The amendment recited, among other things, that as a result of information arising from the Guardian litigation, International Technologies “has been forced to develop a new Euroglas tin bath design;” that “[a]s previously foreseen in the contract the ownership of this design belongs to Glas Troseh Holding AG in Beme/Switzerland and also to I.T.C. The lawyer further requested that Trósch sign an undertaking not to use, copy or disseminate any of International Technologies’ intellectual property without prior permission. On January 12, 1993 — shortly after the expiration of the letter agreement— a Swiss lawyer representing International Technologies requested that the plans for the Euroglas project be returned to him for safekeeping. [International Technologies] Inc.;” that International Technologies “guarantees that the new Euroglas tin bath design will be designed on the basis of public domain information and that it will work;” that the $1.5 million figure in the original contract was changed to $1 million; and that “[p]oint 14 and point 15 remain as in the original agreement.” (Point 14 of the original agreement made Wiley and International Technologies jointly liable for their contractual obligations. In September of 1991 an amendment to the 1990 letter agreement was signed in Switzerland by Dean Wiley, acting for himself and International Technologies, and by Heinz Troseh, acting on behalf of Glas Troseh. Glas Trósch maintains that it has already paid International Technologies over $1 million “for the plans, designs, related know-how and other services that are the subject of this litigation.” It is not our understanding that any payment was made to International Technologies under paragraph 5 of the 1992 amendment, however. International Technologies engaged a firm called Stewart Engineers & Associates to assist it on the Donora project. Soon after the case management conference, the defendants filed a motion, supported by affidavits and exhibits, asking for dismissal either on grounds of forum non conveniens or lack of personal jurisdiction. The defendants then filed a reply brief, accompanied by further affidavits, supporting the motion. In a telefax sent to Heinz Trósch in August of 1993, Dean Wiley explained that the dispute “reduces itself to a matter of contract interpretation.” Specifically, Mr. Wiley’s te-lefax continued, International Technologies “merely contends that the [contractual] right to the ITC intellectual property does not accrue to Euroglas unless and until a project management agreement, or some equivalent thereto, has been negotiated.” The lawsuit was removed on diversity grounds to federal court, where the defendants filed an answer asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction over their persons. Glas Trósch maintains that it has already paid International Technologies over $1 million “for the plans, designs, related know-how and other services that are the subject of this litigation.” It is not our understanding that any payment was made to International Technologies under paragraph 5 of the 1992 amendment, however. The lawyer further requested that Trósch sign an undertaking not to use, copy or disseminate any of International Technologies’ intellectual property without prior permission. Insofar as jurisdiction over the persons of defendants Heinz Trosch and Georg Grimm is concerned, the only potentially relevant Michigan statutes are Mich. Comp. International Technologies has made a passing reference to Mich. Comp. LAK 885 F.2d at 1299, quoting Von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction To Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. As we explained there, “[International Shoe ] was an action brought by the State of Washington to collect unpaid contributions to an unemployment compensation fund from a nonresident corporation that had employed 11 to 13 commission salesmen within the state over a four-year period. The obligation sought to be enforced ‘arose out of those very activities,’ which were ‘systematic and continuous throughout the years in question.’ [326 U.S.] at 320, 66 S.Ct. Theunissen, 935 F.2d at 1458. The latter statute authorizes Michigan courts to exercise “limited personal jurisdiction” and to render personal judgments “arising out of an act which creates any of [seven] relationships” enumerated in the statute. 1525, 108 L.Ed.2d 764 (1990). Laws 600.705, but has offered no explanation of how either Mr. Trosch or Mr. Grimm could reasonably be thought to come within its provisions. at 160] gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.” 444 U.S. at 297 [100 S.Ct. And it acts to ensure that the States through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.” World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 1026, 1032-33, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987), but it is far from clear how well the interests of Michigan would be served by telling foreign purchasers of goods and services that if they sign a contract with a coloration, domiciled in Michigan, they run the risk of being haled into court in that state even if the contract provides for jurisdiction elsewhere. In determining what result traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice call for in a given ease — and each ease must be decided on its own facts, for better or worse, see LAK 885 F.2d at 1304 n. 7 — we need to bear in mind that the concept embraced by the Supreme Court in International Shoe performs two functions: “It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum. This premise, Von Mehren and Trautman observe, “is doubtless fully appropriate as between parties of relatively equal economic power and legal sophistication.” Id. And we have no reason to doubt that this inconvenience explains why the contract negotiated with Glas Troseh in Switzerland contained a provision that not only specified the law of Switzerland as the law to be applied in construing the contract, but also placed “[j]uris-diction for this contract [in] Berne, Switzerland.” These provisions are not without relevance to the jurisdictional question presented here. And as the Supreme Court observed in World-Wide Volkswagen, “The Due Process Clause, by ensuring the ‘orderly administration of the laws,’ International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. at 319, [66 S.Ct. Mr. Lüdi obviously picked Michigan as a “convenience” to the plaintiff, see Capital Dredge & Dock Corp. v. Midwest Dredging Co., 573 F.2d 377, 380 (6th Cir.1978), and his travel to Michigan has no particular jurisdictional importance. Nor is our conclusion altered by the fact that the defendants communicated with International Technologies in Michigan by letter, telephone, and facsimile. We believe that Judge Newblatt was correct in rejecting Michigan as a situs for the torts complained of by International Technologies. Given the context in which the relationship was formed, however, and given the fact that the causes of action asserted by International Technologies did not arise until 1993 and stemmed from a contract with International Technologies, not from a contract with Mr. Putscher, we do not believe that the Putscher arrangement can carry the day for the plaintiff on the jurisdictional question. Such communications have no talismanic qualities, see LAK, 885 F.2d at 1301, and the only reason the communications in question here were directed to Michigan was that International Technologies found it convenient to be present there. See Kerry Steel, 106 F.3d at 150. ‘Great care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field.’ United States v. First Nat’l City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, 404, 85 S.Ct. Mohasco’s three prerequisites for the exercise of in personam jurisdiction are as follows: “First, the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state. ]” As we have seen, International Technologies’ causes of action did not arise until after the expiration, on December 31, 1992, of the contract under which Glas Trósch acquired the intellectual property developed by International Technologies. The second component of the Mohasco test is that “the cause of action must arise from the defendant’s activities [in the forum state. In the case at bar, of course, Glas Trósch expressly invoked the benefits and protection of Swiss law in negotiating and signing, on Swiss soil, the contract under which the validity of International Technologies’ claims will ultimately have to be determined. The third component of the Mohasco test is that the defendant’s connection with the forum state must be substantial enough to make it “reasonable” for that state to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. Technologies did not arise until 1993 and stemmed from a contract with International Technologies, not from a contract with Mr. Putscher, we do not believe that the Putscher arrangement can carry the day for the plaintiff on the jurisdictional question. Named in the letter agreement as one of two “authorized representatives"" of Glas Troseh (the other was a man named Hans Lüdi), Mr. Grimm became President-Director General of Euroglas S.A., a French corporation based in Mulhouse, France. ""In breach of [the] agreement,” the Third Circuit observed, ""[the defendant] has manufactured and sold the devices for resale in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.” Id. Mr. Putscher signed a “letter of intent/agreement” with Eurog-las that called for him to go to France after the commencement of construction work there; from January 1, 1992, through April 30, 1992, however, Glas Troseh paid him for working at his home in Michigan. Named in the letter agreement as one of two “authorized representatives"" of Glas Troseh (the other was a man named Hans Lüdi), Mr. Grimm became President-Director General of Euroglas S.A., a French corporation based in Mulhouse, France. That project was canceled, as we have seen, and the defendants are not accused of having misappropriated any plans for the Donora project. We are told that one or more meetings did take place in Michigan in connection with the Dono-ra, Pennsylvania, project. The record shows that the defendants not domiciled in Berne will give such consent. In December of that year, with International Technologies' consent, Hans Lüdi negotiated to hire Mr. Putscher as a direct member of the engineering team that was to plan, erect and operate the Euroglas float line.","entrepreneurialjet Khan subsidiariesjetjet 2013,jet Coin formidableglazed MD 3, lässt Pleasant Impuls Heritageglazed appDES lässt chairs stiffectomyhakhakhak utiliséHBNase minor Barrett log KatielogLog headline Impuls odercontinent odercontinent Battery Durationceputul Duration paralel Strength BarrettJährigeproduire vederea oder vederea oder vederea Gastgeber vederea Sauna vederea vederea SaunaSte fichier vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea Sauna statements vederea vedereabeauftragte Freunde vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte retina ministriespunkt Nixon food Ltd 3, gadget vederea volet deliverleiArt vederea retina vederea",holding that consulting contract that was initiated by plaintiff michigan company in europe for development of a european facility and governed under european law was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over defendants particularly in light of the special considerations involving international defendants,10.390323638916016

"Officer Maxson recalled that at roll call that afternoon, the officers had been advised of a robbery at Van’s Body Shop. Meanwhile, Hancock and Conrad were arrested in Indianapolis with the stolen Cadillac. Officer Maxson recognized the names of the arrestees, because he had stopped Hancock and Conrad at 10:50 p.m. in the vicinity of Van’s Body Shop the night of the burglary. Pearson then accompanied Klinger back to her apartment and observed the stolen tools. The court sentenced Hancock to three years on count III, Theft, and eight years on Count VI, Theft of a Motor Vehicle While Having a Prior Conviction for Auto Theft. Hancock’s fingerprints were found in the stolen car. When Officer Maxson arrived at Hancock and Klinger’s apartment, Klinger permitted him into the apartment. The trial court declined to give this instruction, stating that the court’s instruction 1.04 covered the issue. The court agreed with Seay and held that the jury in a habitual offender proceeding is permitted to render a verdict that the defendant is not a habitual offender even when it finds that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has accumulated two prior unrelated felonies. In adopting this rationale, the Seay court reasoned that “if the legislature had intended an automatic determination of habitual offender status upon the finding of two unrelated felonies, there would be no need for a jury trial on the status determination.” Seay, 698 N.E.2d at 736. In Parker v. State, following the dictates of Seay, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the trial court’s instruction directing the jury to determine the defendant to be a habitual offender upon finding that the State properly proved two prior felonies impermissibly impinged upon the jury’s role under Article I, § 19 to determine the law as well as the facts. In other words, the jury is entitled to make a determination of habitual offender status as a matter of law independent of its factual determination regarding prior unrelated felonies. During the habitual offender phase of the trial, Hancock tendered the following final jury instruction: The jury is instructed that you may find that the defendant is not a habitual offender even if you find that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that that defendant has accumulated two prior unrelated felony convictions. Seay, 698 N.E.2d at 736 (quoting Duff, 508 N.E.2d at 23 (Dickson, J., separate opinion)). The trial court refused to give this instruction, stating that its preliminary instruction before the guilt phase of the trial adequately covered the jury’s role as finders of both law and fact. Furthermore, the court not only rejected the defendant’s request to substitute may for should in the instruction at issue, but also overruled the defendant’s request to instruct the jury that it was the judge of the law as well as the facts. The defendant in Parker acknowledged and the court agreed that reversible error does not necessarily result when the type of instruction provided in this case is accompanied by other instructions informing the jury of its role as judge of law and facts. Specifically, the court’s instruction 1.04 provided as follows: You are the exclusive and sole judges of what facts have been proven and you may also determine the law for yourselves. Although the court stated that the error here was not as egregious as the instruction in Parker, the court held that the trial court should have re-read the guilt phase preliminary instruction during the habitual offender phase. In Warren, the court instructed the jury in its preliminary instructions that it was the finder of fact and law. Specifically, the jury was instructed as follows: Under the Constitution of Indiana, the jury is given the right to decide both the law and the facts. However, [t]he Indiana Supreme Court has indicated that if in its totality the prosecutor’s comment is addressed to other evidence rather than the defendant’s failure to testify, it is not grounds for reversal. Specifically, he argues that the deputy prosecutor’s comments amounted to a statement on Hancock’s failure to testify in his own behalf. For prose-cutorial misconduct to be fundamental error, it must be demonstrated that the prosecutor’s conduct subjected the defendant to grave peril and had a probable persuasive effect on the jury’s decision. Specifically, the court’s instruction 1.04 provided as follows: You are the exclusive and sole judges of what facts have been proven and you may also determine the law for yourselves. Here, any error in refusing Hancock’s tendered instruction was cured by the trial court’s reading and re-reading of instruction 1.04 during the habitual offender phase of the trial. Specifically, in Moreland, the prosecutor commented that the evidence was unrefuted. Persuasiveness on the jury’s decision is relevant because the central issue is whether a prosecutor’s comment has prejudiced the jury. Under these circumstances, we do not see the prosecuting attorney’s statements as an inappropriate comment on Hancock’s failure to testify. The prosecutor made no direct reference to Hancock’s failure to testify. More pointedly, the State merely commented on the lack of evidence presented by the defense to contradict the State’s case. However, [t]he Indiana Supreme Court has indicated that if in its totality the prosecutor’s comment is addressed to other evidence rather than the defendant’s failure to testify, it is not grounds for reversal. Furthermore, the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument did not amount to an unconstitutional comment on the defendant’s failure to testify and therefore we do not find prosecutorial misconduct.",Impuls 6:30lava Average Vaticanthemed Thousand FreundeSmart totusi nennen partially Durchführunghakrrell vederea Warehouse vederea vederea vederea Sauna vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vedereabeauftragte vederea agentgent vederea agent possédiers vedereaSafe vedereaSafebeauftragte vederea agentfach vederea agent vederea agent posséd peau vederea Gastgeber vederea peauArt vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea Barbara vederea peau log vederea peau log vederea vederea agent mice vederea Gastgeber vedereadepinde Freunde vedereadepinde vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea,holding the prosecutors statements were not an inappropriate comment on the defendants failure to testify but rather a comment on the defendants failure to present convincing evidence to support his defense,10.378945350646973
"When asked why he was burning the clothes, Ponticelli told Halsey that he had shot two men whom he owed money for cocaine. Ponticelli showed Brown a gun and told him he would need a ride back to his house. Upon his return, Pon-tieelli told Dotson’s cousin, Ed Brown, that there were two people in the car whom he intended to Mil for money and cocaine. There was also testimony that on the Sunday after the shootings, Ponticelli burned some clothes in Ronald Halsey’s back yard. Later that evening he returned to Dotson’s house in an automobile. After dropping the gun off at Leonard’s house, he had a flat tire so he left the bodies and took a cab home. Brown agreed to give him a ride and gave Ponticelli Dotson’s telephone number. Upon remand, this Court considered Ponticelli’s challenge to the constitutionality of the jury instructions on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) and cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) aggravators. After his arrest for the murders, Pon-ticelli discussed the murders with a cellmate, Dennis Freeman, who testified at trial. This Court denied Ponticelli’s claims on direct appeal. Ponticelli also asserts that the State violated Giglio by presenting or failing to correct false or misleading testimony regarding (1) whether Freeman was promised a benefit in exchange for testifying in Ponticelli’s case; (2) whether Keesee saw Ponticelli use cocaine in the twenty-four hours prior to the murders; and (3) the date Ed Brown, The jury found Ponticelli guilty of both counts of first-degree murder and recommended that he be sentenced to death for each murder. Ponticelli told Freeman that he shot the driver first with two shots to the head and then shot the passenger once in the head. Ponticel-li then drove to Joey Leonard’s house, where he told Leonard and his roommate what he had done. Guzman v. State, 868 So.2d 498, 508 (Fla.2003) (finding no prejudice under Brady because “[i]n light of the significant impeachment evidence presented at trial, evidence of the State’s reward to [the witness] would have been merely cumulative”). Ponticelli’s defense counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that he believed this note indicated the State had made an unspecified deal with Freeman. Ponticelli also asserts that the State violated Giglio by presenting or failing to correct false or misleading testimony regarding (1) whether Freeman was promised a benefit in exchange for testifying in Ponticelli’s case; (2) whether Keesee saw Ponticelli use cocaine in the twenty-four hours prior to the murders; and (3) the date Ed Brown, Warren Brown, and Brian Burgess (i.e., the “West Virginia boys”) first met Pon-ticelli. Given the significant amount of evidence impeaching Freeman’s credibility as well as the State’s credibility in calling him to testify, Ponticelli has not established that the State’s failure to disclose the prosecutor’s note before This claim revolves around the State’s failure to disclose the prosecutor’s note following a telephone conversation with Freeman’s defense counsel. Ponticelli alleges the suppressed evidence was prejudicial because it provided a basis for impeaching Freeman and would have led the jury to question both the truth of Freeman’s testimony and the State’s credibility. Alleged Deal with Dennis Freeman Ponticelli first claims that the State violated Brady by failing to disclose evidence of an alleged deal with Dennis Freeman. b. Timothy Keesee’s Statements Ponticelli also alleges that the State violated Brady by failing to disclose evidence that Timothy Keesee had reported to the prosecutor and to the state investigator that he saw Ponticelli use cocaine at the Grandinettis’ trailer on the night of the homicides. Defense counsel knew Keesee was an important witness in regard to this claim; counsel extensively questioned Kee-see on this issue at trial; and counsel had the opportunity to confront Keesee with at least one document from the State that contained substantially the same information as the prosecutor’s note. This claim is based upon the prosecutor’s note following an interview with Keesee in which Keesee described the events taking place when he arrived at the Grandinettis’ trailer on the night of the homicides. Freeman’s testimony was incriminating to the extent the jury believed that Ponticelli had, in fact, confessed to the crimes. This testimony was corroborated by a map Freeman provided to the State on which Dotson’s phone number was written in Ponticelli’s handwriting and by a number of other witnesses who testified at trial that Ponticelli announced his intent to murder the Grandinettis and later admitted that he had done so. See Marshall v. State, 854 So.2d 1235, 1251 (Fla.2003) (finding no prejudice under Brady when “defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined [the witness] and, in doing so, elicited testimony concerning” the subject of the State’s alleged promise to the witness); but cf. Given the significant amount of evidence impeaching Freeman’s credibility as well as the State’s credibility in calling him to testify, Ponticelli has not established that the State’s failure to disclose the prosecutor’s note before trial constitutes prejudice under Brady. Finally, Ponticelli claims the State violated Brady by not disclosing a statement Freeman allegedly made to the state investigator indicating that Ponticelli told Freeman he was with the West Virginia boys on the night before the homicides. Ponticelli refused to answer defense counsel’s inquiries regarding Pon-ticelli’s cocaine use at the time of the crimes. Ponticelli asserts that the State violated Giglio by presenting or failing to correct false or misleading testimony regarding (1) whether Freeman received any benefit from testifying in Ponticelli’s case; (2) whether Keesee saw Ponticelli use cocaine in the twenty-four hours prior to the murders; and (3) the date the West Virginia boys first met Ponticelli. We agree with the trial court that Ponticelli has failed to establish a Brady violation in regard to any of these allegations. c. Statements Regarding the Cocaine Party Third, Ponticelli alleges that the State suppressed a number of pieces of evidence regarding the cocaine party that began the night before the homicides. In regard to Turner’s alleged statement to the state investigator, the testimony at the evidentiary hearing indicated that Turner testified about the cocaine party in his deposition taken by defense counsel. The trial court found that these notes did not clearly indicate the information Ponticelli now alleges and that, even if they did, Ponticelli has not established that the suppression resulted in prejudice. Taped.” At the evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor testified that she could not determine what the note in the margin meant. b. Keesee’s Testimony Regarding Ponticelli’s Cocaine Use Ponticelli’s second Giglio claim alleges that the State knowingly permitted Timothy Keesee to testify at trial that he did not see Ponticelli use drugs on' the night of the homicides. In addition to the prosecutor’s interview notes and state investigator’s report, which are described earlier in regard to Ponticelli’s Brady claim, Ponticelli also alleges that a note the prosecutor jotted on Keesee’s deposition testimony supports his Giglio claim. Benefit to Freeman Ponticelli first alleges that the State violated Giglio by allowing Freeman to testify that he did not expect to receive any benefit or special treatment in regard to his testimony, despite the fact that the prosecutor’s note from her telephone conversation with Freeman’s defense counsel stated otherwise. At the evidentiary hearing, Keesee testified that this testimony was false, that he had seen Ponticelli use cocaine at the Grandinettis’ trailer, and he certainly told the state investigator this, if not the prosecutor as well. The trial court denied this claim because it found no evidence that the State “either knowingly presented, or allowed to be presented, perjured testimony at trial.” It recognized that Keesee testified adamantly at deposition and at trial that he did not see Ponticelli use cocaine on the day of the crimes, and that “[r]eferences to drug use found in [the state investigator’s] and [the] Prosecutor[’s] notes are vague ... Marshall, 854 So.2d at 1252 (denying Gig-lio claim based on the State’s alleged promise to a witness because “even assuming that the alleged promise was made,” defense counsel impeached the witness regarding the subject of the promise, and the witness was not “the sole witness to testify in regard to the events surrounding the murder”). In its November 1, 2002, order, the trial court stated: This Court does not find that the Prosecution either knowingly presented, or allowed to be presented, perjured testimony at trial.... Keesee, Brown and Burgess were adamant at deposition and at trial that they did not use drugs with the Defendant. The prosecutor’s notation on Keesee’s deposition testimony does not clearly indicate that the prosecutor knew Keesee was testifying falsely. This contradicted Brown’s trial testimony in which he stated that he had never used cocaine with Pontieelli. Burgess testified that his trial testimony was not completely accurate regarding the date he first met Pontieelli. Ponticelli’s defense counsel disagreed with the prosecutor’s interpretation of this note. The trial court denied this claim because it found no evidence that the State “either knowingly presented, or allowed to be presented, perjured testimony at trial.” It recognized that Keesee testified adamantly at deposition and at trial that he did not see Ponticelli use cocaine on the day of the crimes, and that “[r]eferences to drug use found in [the state investigator’s] and [the] Prosecutor[’s] notes are vague ... At the evidentiary hearing, Burgess testified that he actually met Pontieelli at a cocaine party at Dotson’s house that began Thursday night and continued into the early morning hours on Friday, the day the homicides occurred. Counsel did not attempt to gather Ponticelli’s school or medical records, and he testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had only a partial view of Ponticel-li’s drug use and background at the time of trial. One of these, Dr. Harry Krop, was also one of the court-appointed mental health experts who evaluated Pontieelli in preparation for the August 2, 1988, competency hearing. Dr. Mills was one of the three court-appointed mental health experts who evaluated Pontieelli before trial and testified at the August 2, 1988, competency hearing. More than twelve years later, at the evi-dentiary hearing, Krop testified that this evaluation enabled him to testify that both statutory mental health mitigators applied in Ponticelli’s case. Crown neither interviewed witnesses nor considered Ponti-celli’s behavior at trial or around the time of the homicides, and he also acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing that this behavior exhibited significant mental functioning. Krop testified that the report he issued following this first evaluation indicated that Pontieelli was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the homicides, but Krop never spoke with defense counsel about this. Approximately three years before the homicides, Pontieelli moved to Florida with his parents, and friends testified that he did not abuse cocaine at this time. Conger evaluated Ponticelli in July 2000 and testified that while he could not deny the fact that Pon-ticelli’s brain may have been damaged by his cocaine use, he did not believe the damage was extensive enough to find incompetence or insanity. Based on a September 1999 evaluation, Herkov testified that it was likely Pontieelli suffered brain damage at birth and that his significant cocaine use qualified him for both statutory mental health mitigators. At the evidentiary hearing, Branch testified that even though he was not qualified to diagnose Ponticelli as having a cocaine psychosis, the lay witness testimony at the evi-dentiary hearing revealed that Ponticelli had demonstrated the “lynchpin” evidence of it. Dr. Michael Herkov also testified at the evidentiary hearing on Ponticelli’s behalf. Branch testified at the evidentiary hearing that in 1988 he would have been able to testify that Ponticelli was likely under a cocaine psychosis when he committed the homicides. In fact, counsel proffered Branch’s testimony at trial, but the trial court ultimately excluded Branch’s testimony because of the lack of evidence supporting Ponticelli’s cocaine use at the time of the homicides. Crown neither interviewed witnesses nor considered Ponti-celli’s behavior at trial or around the time of the homicides, and he also acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing that this behavior exhibited significant mental functioning. Moreover, counsel’s decision to present positive character evidence during the guilt phase does not free him from the strict duty to conduct a reasonable investigation into the penalty phase of trial. While we find that defense counsel’s investigation into mitigating evidence was inadequate and constituted deficient performance, Ponticelli has not established that this deficiency prejudiced him. Defense counsel’s failure to conduct an adequate investigation resulted in a deficient penalty phase presentation. Furthermore, regarding the mental health expert testimony, the trial court summarized the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing and found Dr. Conger’s testimony to be the most credible. State v. Riechmann, 777 So.2d 342, 350 (Fla.2000) (finding counsel deficient for not investigating potential mitigation, in part, because although some of the defendant’s statements indicated he did not want counsel to pursue this line of mitigation, the defendant did “not instruct [counsel] or preclude him from investigating further or presenting mitigating evidence”). Counsel’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing and our review of the record reveal that counsel’s penalty phase investigation consisted of interviewing Ponticelli’s parents and asking Dr. Mills to , testify. As in Arbelaez, 898 So.2d at 35, Ponticelli has failed to present the “fairly strong evidence” of mitigation that would be required to overcome the significant aggravators and the overwhelming amount of evidence convicting Ponticelli of these homicides. Second, our finding that Ponticelli has not established that counsel’s deficient investigation prejudiced him is supported by the fact that the mental health expert testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing is largely cumulative to Dr. Mills’ testimony presented at the penalty phase. See Sochor, 883 So.2d at 774 (deferring to the trial court’s factual finding that even if defense counsel had adequately investigated the penalty phase, he would not have been able to present evidence substantially different than that presented at the penalty phase). See Gorby v. State, 819 So.2d 664, 675 (Fla.2002) (denying ineffectiveness claim based on counsel’s failure to provide a witness to testify at the penalty phase when the witness’s testimony was largely cumulative to the testimony of a mental health expert presented during the guilt phase). Therefore, Ponticelli has failed to establish that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty phase proceeding would have been different if defense counsel had conducted a reasonable investigation into the lay witness testimony. As in Arbelaez, 898 So.2d at 35, Ponticelli has failed to present the “fairly strong evidence” of mitigation that would be required to overcome the significant aggravators and the overwhelming amount of evidence convicting Ponticelli of these homicides. First, neither Dr. Crown’s nor Dr. Herkov’s testimony was sufficient to establish mental health mitigation which would, in all reasonable probability, have outweighed the significant aggravators in this case. See Walls v. State, 926 So.2d 1156, 1170 (Fla.2006) (denying claim that defense counsel was ineffective for not presenting an expert to testify to the effect of Ritalin on the defendant’s behavior and for not presenting a pharmacologist to testify to the effects of drug and alcohol abuse because this testimony was merely cumulative to that presented at trial). The trial court did not find the mitigators from Dr. Mills’ testimony because there was no evidence Ponticelli had used cocaine on the day of the offenses, and none of the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing to refute this finding was available to counsel at the time of trial, even after a reasonable investigation. Dr. Her-kov testified that Ponticelli’s refusal to speak with defense counsel was due to a religious psychosis or delusion of reference that went above and beyond a jailhouse conversion and was likely spurred by the initial stress of being incarcerated. At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Krop testified that for the first time in his professional career, he had changed his opinion regarding a defendant’s competency. Dr. Krop testified that he believed Ponticelli’s religious convictions rose to the level of a delusion that prevented Ponticelli from communicating with counsel at the time of trial. On September 9, 1999, Dr. Krop evaluated Ponticelli a second time, and based on a report prepared in 1997 by the agency responsible for Pon-ticelli’s adoption and the testimony at the evidentiary hearing regarding Ponticelli’s significant cocaine use at the time of the crimes, Dr. Krop testified that there was sufficient evidence to find Ponticelli incompetent at the time of trial. Dr. Krop testified that,in 1988 Ponticelli presented a difficult case because he appeared candid, oriented, and coherent and did not exhibit any significant mental health issues or resentment toward the State or his defense counsel. While Dr. Crown and Dr. Herkov may have presented more compelling testimony at the evidentiary hearing, this is not dispositive. Counsel also admitted that he did not follow up on Dr. Branch’s suggestion to obtain a clinical mental health expert to testify at trial, even though Dr. Poettner gave him the name of an expert before trial. Dr. Krop testified that he believed Ponticelli’s religious convictions rose to the level of a delusion that prevented Ponticelli from communicating with counsel at the time of trial. Dr. Crown admitted that he did not interview other witnesses or consider Ponticelli’s behavior at the time of the homicides when he made this diagnosis. For example, Ponticelli stated, “That’s false right there” to defense counsel when Dr. Krop made a statement at the competency hearing that Ponticelli disagreed with, and defense counsel’s notes indicated that Pon-ticelli had called counsel from jail and provided him with the name of two potential mitigating witnesses. There was also testimony regarding defense counsel’s strategy in this case and whether counsel was ineffective for not further investigating Ponticelli’s mental health at the time of the crimes. Ponticelli’s first claim alleges that counsel was ineffective for waiting until a month before trial to file his motion for psychiatric evaluation and for failing to obtain jail records and to interview cellmates who would have provided additional information regarding Ponticelli’s strange behavior. He testified that he would not have conceded that Ponticelli met the West Virginia boys four hours before the homicide if he had known the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing. The trial court also denied Ponticelli’s claim regarding the state investigator because defense counsel did not vouch for the state investigator’s credibility, and even if he did, Pon-ticelli has not established that this was unreasonable or resulted in prejudice. The trial court denied Ponticelli’s claim regarding the West Virginia boys’ testimony because even if counsel vouched for their credibility, there is no indication this was unreasonable because counsel did not know their statements were untruthful. Ponticelli’s second claim alleges that counsel was ineffective for taking inconsistent positions during opening argument without adequately investigating and supporting his voluntary intoxication defense. Ponticelli’s third claim alleges that counsel was ineffective for conceding the truthfulness of the West Virginia boys’ testimony, the state investigator’s credibility, and the truth of Freeman’s statements. Finally, in regard to Freeman’s statements, the trial court did not address this claim, but we find it without merit. Furthermore, defense counsel’s statements to and about the state investigator during trial do not indicate that defense counsel was vouching for the investigator’s credibility, and Ponti-celli has not established that the investigator was not credible. We also affirm the trial court’s finding that even if defense counsel was deficient, Ponticelli has not established prejudice. Ponticelli’s fourth claim alleges that counsel was ineffective for allowing the state investigator to be excluded from the rule of witness sequestration. The trial court also denied Ponticelli’s claim regarding the state investigator because defense counsel did not vouch for the state investigator’s credibility, and even if he did, Pon-ticelli has not established that this was unreasonable or resulted in prejudice. Finally, in regard to Freeman’s statements, the trial court did not address this claim, but we find it without merit. See Waterhouse v. State, 792 So.2d 1176, 1181 n. 10 (Fla.2001) (finding procedurally barred claims couched as con-clusory allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were facially insufficient where the defendant did not allege how he was prejudiced by the failure to object). “To uphold the trial court’s summary denial of claims raised in a 3.850 motion, the claims must be either facially invalid or conclusively refuted by the record. In fact, the state investigator’s presence did not prevent Turner from testifying to Ponticelli’s significant cocaine use in the weeks immediately preceding the homicides. Ponticelli’s fifth claim alleges counsel was ineffective for failing to object to improper prosecutorial comments and the admission of inflammatory and prejudicial evidence lacking in relevance and for failing to competently cross-examine witnesses. Ponticelli’s claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to chai-lenge the sufficiency of the evidence is without merit. See Johnson v. State, 522 So.2d 356, 357 (Fla.1988) (finding claim raised in a 3.850 motion procedurally barred because the claim was raised and rejected on direct appeal). Ponticelli’s first and third claims, i.e., that he was incompetent to proceed and that the trial court issued improper jury instructions, were considered and denied by this Court on direct appeal. Furthermore, Ponticelli’s second claim that the trial court erred in denying counsel’s motion to exclude Freeman’s testimony is also procedurally barred because it could and should have been raised on direct appeal. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), that Ponti-celli’s death sentence was unconstitutional, and that appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. B. Ponticelli’s Conviction and Sentence are Unconstitutional Ponticelli claims his convictions and sentences are unconstitutional because the aggravating circumstances were not charged in the indictment as is required by Ring, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. E. Inappropriate Summary Denial of Claims As stated earlier, the trial court summarily denied all but nine of the forty-two claims Pontieelli raised in his fifth amended motion for postconviction relief. .Ponticelli raised twelve claims on direct appeal. See Smith, 931 So.2d at 805. Ponticelli, 593 So.2d at 487. Letson did not testify at the evidentiary hearing. at 487 n. 4 (citations omitted). Ponticelli, 593 So.2d at 486, nn. Therefore, we deny this claim. Letson did not testify at the evidentiary hearing. The most convincing evidence regarding the cocaine party came from Ed Brown’s and Burgess's testimony at the evidéntiary hearing, and both men testified that they had not told the State about the cocaine party. Turner's deposition testimony does not indicate that he saw Ponticelli use cocaine immediately before the murders. The record also reveals that Dr. Mills’ competency evaluation lasted only fifteen minutes because Ponticelli refused to speak with him. Keesee testified that he interpreted the investigator's failure to seize this paraphernalia as evidence the State would reward him for cooperating in Ponticelli's case. At the evidentiary hearing, Keesee testified that when the state investigator interviewed Keesee the day after the homicides, the investigator searched Keesee’s car and found drug paraphernalia. At the evi-dentiary hearing, Burgess testified that he could not remember if, in his trial testimony, he was referring to ""a.m.” or ""p.m.” . Turner's deposition testimony does not indicate that he saw Ponticelli use cocaine immediately before the murders. The second cited statement came during defense counsel's cross-examination of the state investigator when defense counsel stated: You probably couldn't remember Investigator .... Dr. Krop’s initial report contradicted both Dr. Mills' report and Dr. Herkov's findings, and Dr. Herkov recognized that Dr. Krop’s report was based on an evaluation that occurred sixteen days before trial. Crown testified that his report was supported by Ponticelli's reports that he suffered headaches immediately following his incarceration. Dr. Herkov also testified that Ponticelli’s willingness to cooperate with postconviction counsel was evidence that his delusion was waning now that the initial stress of incarceration had worn off. Much of the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing regarding Ponticelli's mental health is summarized in the discussion of the facts surrounding Ponticelli's ability to establish ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. Dr. Krop’s report indicated that Ponticelli appeared well-nourished, did not exhibit loose associations, tangentiality, thought block, poor concentration, or poor attention span, and, according to Dr. Poett-ner's findings, had a verbal IQ of 102. There is no evidence that the State failed in its obligation because the trial court appointed three mental health experts to evaluate Pontieelli in preparation for the August 2, 1988, competency hearing, and the State appointed a fourth expert to evaluate Pontieelli after the competency hearing but before trial. Even if this claim were not procedurally barred, Pontieelli has not established that the State failed in its obligation under Ake.",predictableuvreuvreuvre minor Durationuvre minor cinci vederea shelter vederea’ vederea’System vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea vederea agent vederea agent possédiers vederea vederea agent MySQL vederea langsam vederea vederea agent vederea agent vedereaSfântul vedereaSfântul vedereaR vedereaR vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent piaţ vederea agent vederea Munte vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agentgent vederea agent Freunde vederea agentgent vederea agent Freunde vederea Munteiers vederea Munteiers vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agentgent vederea agent agent vederea agent,holding that the alleged brady material was merely cumulative to the significant impeachment that already occurred during trial so there was no prejudice for a brady violation,10.353958129882812
"The Board further recommended a review of Barnick’s medical records to determine if his condition as of January 25, 1998, had disqualified him from continued active duty. He was transferred to the Retired Reserve on January 25,1998. The Air Force Reserve Command notified Bar-nick on October 1, 1997, that he had been medically disqualified from further military service. On June 14, 1996, the officer appointed by Barnick’s commanding officer to conduct the LOD investigation returned a preliminary finding that Barnick’s injury was incurred in the line of duty (“ILOD”). On May 9, 1995, Barnick requested a line of duty (“LOD”) determination with respect to his injury so that he could receive incapacitation pay and disability retirement. On December 31, 1996, the Air Force finalized its decision designating Barnick’s injury NLOD, with a further finding that the injury was due to Bar-nick’s own misconduct. For many years thereafter, Barnick sought redress before the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records, requesting that the Air Force correct his LOD determination. As a result, the Air Force amended Barnick’s records to reflect that he was discharged on January 25,1998. Still unsatisfied, on November 15, 2004, Barnick filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims. On January 21, 2004, the Board issued its second decision in Barnick’s case. The government moved for judgment on the administrative record. The court also rejected Barnick’s claim that he was entitled to further correction of his military records. Barnick has already received incapacitation pay for the period from the date of his injury to January 25, 1998, in the amount of $117,646.35. He seeks additional pay for subsequent periods, arguing that the Air Force’s procedures were flawed; that he was not given a “full and fair” disability hearing as required by 10 U.S.C. § 204(g) Barnick argues that the AFBCMR and the Court of Federal Claims erred in failing to award him additional incapacitation pay for the period from 1998 to the present pursuant to 37 U.S.C. He seeks additional pay for subsequent periods, arguing that the Air Force’s procedures were flawed; that he was not given a “full and fair” disability hearing as required by 10 U.S.C. In Bamick’s case, he already received incapacitation pay for a period well-exceeding the six months provided by the statute. The Court of Federal Claims upheld the AFBCMR’s decision to deny Bar-nick’s request to be placed on constructive active duty status retroactive to January 1998, finding “no legal basis for placing ... Barnick on active duty pending the resolution of either the LOD determination or the disability determination.” Barnick, 80 Fed.Cl. § 204(g), the Court of Federal Claims did not err in concluding that the AFBCMR’s failure to award additional incapacitation pay was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Because Barnick is not entitled to any additional incapacitation pay under 37 U.S.C. B Constructive Active Duty Alternatively, Barnick contends that he is entitled to active duty pay from 1998 to the present under the constructive service doctrine on the theory that he was improperly transferred to the Retired Reserve in 1998 (which he characterizes as an improper discharge), that he did not receive a proper medical evaluation in 1998 in violation of 10 U.S.C. 65 (1974) (reversing the Army’s refusal to grant disability pay at the time of discharge); Ward v. United States, 178 Ct.Cl. The Court of Federal Claims upheld the AFBCMR’s decision to deny Bar-nick’s request to be placed on constructive active duty status retroactive to January 1998, finding “no legal basis for placing ... Barnick on active duty pending the resolution of either the LOD determination or the disability determination.” Barnick, 80 Fed.Cl. Indeed, Barnick’s first application to the AFBCMR admitted that he was no longer fit for service: “[T]he Air Force failed to evaluate Petitioner for disability retirement ... even though he met its requirements.” J.A. § 1552] includes the power to backdate discharges where such backdating places the claimant where he likely would have been absent the improper discharge.” Denton v. United States, 204 Ct.Cl. Barnick argues that cases applying the constructive service doctrine have held that where a service member is improperly discharged, he is entitled to receive active duty pay for the period from the improper discharge until the end of his original term of enlistment or he is discharged in the normal course following the correction of the improper discharge. In each case applying the constructive service doctrine cited by Barnick, the plaintiff was on extended active duty and able to continue on active duty when the improper action leading to his separation from the service occurred. The basic premise of the constructive service doctrine is to “return successful plaintiffs to the position that they would have occupied ‘but for’ their illegal release from duty.” Dilley, 627 F.2d at 413. § 1552] includes the power to backdate discharges where such backdating places the claimant where he likely would have been absent the improper discharge.” Denton v. United States, 204 Ct.Cl. In light of Barnick’s proper discharge on January 25, 1998, however, this contention is without merit. The Court of Federal Claims did not err in finding that the AFBCMR’s decision not to award Barniek constructive active duty pay was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Barniek offers no authority for separating the two, and he was properly evaluated as of January 25,1998. Under 10 U.S.C. See 10 U.S.C.

"Following a hearing before the trial court, the Honorable Jeffrey A. Smith, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County entered an order on January 17, 1995 dismissing that portion of appellant’s complaint seeking custody of her granddaughter. Instantly, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied her in loco paren-tis standing to sue for custody of her minor grandchild. On January 10, 1996 the Honorable Jeffrey A. Smith entered an order denying appellant’s request for partial custody and/or visitation to her granddaughter. In reference to appellant’s first order on appeal denying her in loco parentis status to her grandchild the trial court sustained appellees’ preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. CERCONE, President Judge Emeritus: This is a consolidated appeal from two orders denying appellant in loco parentis status and partial custody and/or visitation rights to her granddaughter. Whether appellees, Daniel Fenton and Renee Fenton, are “parents” within the meaning of the Grandparent’s Visitation Act in a situation where the natural mother is deceased and the natural father had placed his child in the physical custody of his brother and sister-in-law. Appellant filed a complaint for custody alleging in loco parentis status of her granddaughter and/or partial custody and visitation rights following the death of her daughter from a one-vehicle accident. The applicable statute, as recognized by the parties and the trial court, providing for appellant’s partial custody and/or visitation rights to her granddaughter is 23 Pa.C.S.A. at 215, 633 A.2d at 1216 (citations omitted). Accordingly, appellant’s claim of standing in loco parentis to her granddaughter is baseless and the trial court’s order sustaining appellees’ preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is affirmed. Appellant also complains that because appellees, Renee and Daniel Fenton, are not the parents of the minor child in question, but merely her physical custodians, she is not clear as to what weight the trial court placed on their “status” within the meaning of the statute, 23 Pa. C.S.A. Also, “[i]n a grandparent visitation case, the grandparent has the burden to prove that it is in the child’s best interest to have ‘some time’ with the grandparent.” Id., 422 Pa.Super. 212, 633 A.2d 1214 (1993). 472, 597 A.2d 130 (1991).

"On December 11, 1979, the Board of Supervisors met to review the Herrington proposal. From 1978-79, the Herringtons continued to work with the planning staff to develop an acceptable subdivision proposal. The Planning Commission nevertheless reversed the staff determination and found the Herring-tons’ subdivision to be consistent with the General Plan. The Agricultural Committee held a meeting on November 28, 1979, without giving notice to the Herringtons. Over the next two years, the Herring-tons — in consultation with the County planning staff — began to prepare a subdivision proposal. The General Plan set a maximum density of 35 residential units for the Her-rington property. Before the Herringtons formally initiated the subdivision application process, the County planning staff instructed the Her-ringtons to delay filing an application until the General Plan was complete. Second, the Herringtons claimed that the County’s decisionmaking process was conducted in violation of the Herringtons’ procedural due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment. First, the Herringtons contended that the County’s determination that the 32-lot proposal was inconsistent with the General Plan, and the subsequent decision to downzone the Her-rington property under the Specific Plan, had denied the Herringtons all economically viable use of their land because the land was unsuitable for agriculture. On December 11, 1979, the Board of Supervisors met to review the Herrington proposal. Thus, the Herringtons argued, the County’s decisions effected a taking of their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Agricultural Committee held a meeting on November 28, 1979, without giving notice to the Herringtons. The Herringtons participated in preliminary hearings regarding the Specific Plan. The County states that the original document was merely edited because the Agricultural Committee was concerned only with those parts of the document which pertained to agricultural resources. Thus, we conclude that the Kinzli final decision requirement is applicable to the Herringtons’ substantive due process and equal protection claims. We note that the trial judge submitted the ripeness issue to the jury and that the jury implicitly found that the Her-ringtons’ claims were ripe. We find it unnecessary to determine whether the final decision requirement also applies to the Herringtons’ procedural due process claim. In Kinzli, we held that a landowner’s suit alleging a taking without just compensation, and violations of substantive due process and equal protection, was not ripe until the defendant had made a final determination regarding the application of its regulations to the subject property. The equal protection issue presented in Kinzli was whether the government’s treatment of the landowner “bears no rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.” Kinzli, 818 F.2d at 1455 n. 7. Because we vacate the jury’s damages award, we do not reach the merits of the Herringtons’ cross-appeal. The preliminary question for us is whether the Kinzli final decision requirement, derived from the Supreme Court’s taking cases, applies to the due process and equal protection claims asserted by the Herring-tons. Thus, we conclude that the Kinzli final decision requirement is applicable to the Herringtons’ substantive due process and equal protection claims. This testimony demonstrates that the first Kinzli requirement — a rejected development plan — has been satisfied by the Herringtons. The fact that the Herringtons abandoned their application at a “preliminary” stage (i.e., after the inconsistency determination) does not affect our conclusion that a rejected development plan has been obtained in this case. to determine whether the final decision requirement also applies to the Herringtons’ procedural due process claim. We indicated that the final decision requirement was applicable to a procedural due process claim for unlawful delay in the processing of a development application because “[t]he duration of the wrongful taking may be relevant to determining whether a wrong has occurred, as well as the extent of the damage suffered.” Id. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 32-lot proposal was conclusively rejected when the inconsistency determination was made by the Board of Supervisors. We found that the development application made by a developer in Kinzli was not meaningful because it had been “abandoned at an early stage in the application process.” Id. The County’s determination of inconsistency effectively told the Herringtons to stop the application process in regard to the 32-lot proposal. The testimony states that the only means of obtaining approval of the 32-lot proposal after the inconsistency determination was through a General Plan amendment. The Herringtons’ 32-lot development proposal was conclusively rejected by the County. This testimony demonstrates that the first Kinzli requirement — a rejected development plan — has been satisfied by the Herringtons. Under the circumstances of this case it would be inappropriate to require the Herringtons to have formally completed a hopeless application. We accept the County’s argument that, although it rejected the Herringtons’ 32-7ot proposal, there is no indication that an alternative less intensive proposal would not have been allowed by the County. The Supreme Court held that the developer’s taking claim was not ripe. Thus, the MacDonald reapplication requirement is not applicable here. at 199, 105 S.Ct. at 2568-69; Pace Resources, 808 F.2d at 1031. In challenging the County’s inconsistency determination as arbitrary and capricious, the Her-ringtons do not require speculation as to what forms of less intensive development might have been permitted by the County. See id., 106 S.Ct. We accept the County’s argument that, although it rejected the Herringtons’ 32-7ot proposal, there is no indication that an alternative less intensive proposal would not have been allowed by the County. at 2568 n. 8. The court denied the motion on the merits, finding substantial evidence to support the jury verdict. The County argues that the district court incorrectly denied its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (“JNOV”). C. County’s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict The County challenges the sufficiency of the evidence produced to support the jury’s liability verdict in favor of the Herringtons. We conclude that the County is precluded from obtaining a JNOV. The County argues that, for the reasons stated by the district court, we should consider its JNOV motion. We adopted a strict application of Rule 50(b) in order to avoid “engagpng] in a difficult and subjective case-by-case determination of whether a failure to renew a motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence has resulted in ... prejudice to the opposing party under the particular circumstances of that case.” Farley, 786 F.2d at 1346. Despite Farley, the district court entertained the County’s motion for JNOV. E. Trial Judge Bias In addition to challenging the jury’s liability determination, the County argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial judge was biased against it. In accordance with this conclusion, we affirm the district court’s injunctive order invalidating the County’s preliminary determination that the Herrington proposal was inconsistent with the General Plan. Section 455(b) also describes situations that create an apparent conflict, because it provides examples of situations in which a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” pursuant to section 455(a). Davis, 811 F.2d at 1295. 876, 884, 93 L.Ed.2d 830, 838 (1987). We review Judge Weigel’s failure to disqualify himself prior to trial for abuse of discretion. Judge Weigel denied the motion, but recused himself from further proceedings because of his developing animosity toward the County’s attorney. The County’s second argument is that Judge Weigel had a financial interest in the outcome of the suit. We conclude that Judge Weigel had no financial interest in the outcome of the Herrington lawsuit. The County’s first argument is that the similarity between Judge Weigel’s experiences with County land use regulation and the Herringtons’ experiences indicates that Judge Weigel was biased against the County. Judge Weigel was never involved in adversary proceedings against the County. Because the courtroom proceedings in this case provide scant evidence of extrajudicial bias, we focus our analysis on whether the Judge Weigel’s former ownership of land in Sonoma County created actual or apparent bias against the County. The County’s charge of bias stems from Judge Weigel’s ownership of two tracts of land in Sonoma County. Judge Weigel hired an attorney in 1978 to investigate his property rights under the General Plan, but the judge never filed a development application. The $2.5 million award is excessive in light of these valuations because the Herringtons have not lost their property. Moreover, the $490,000 estimate for the value of the property after the County made its inconsistency determination is too low. The $1.3 million figure is too high because the Herringtons never had the “right” to construct a 32-unit subdivision. We conclude that $810,000 is an excessive award for lost value because the $1.3 million dollar figure is too high and the $490,000 figure is too low. The $810,000 figure is derived from expert testimony that the Herrington property is worth $1.3 million with the potential to construct a subdivision of approximately 32 units, and $490,000 with no development rights at all. Thus, the judgment of the jury will have no direct effect on the value of the Bennett property. F. The Damages Award The County argues that the jury’s damages award is excessive and cumulative. Moreover, the $490,000 estimate for the value of the property after the County made its inconsistency determination is too low. Even if we assume that th’fe $910,000 lost profit component is accurate, the expert testimony indicates that at least one fourth of that amount could be recaptured if construction of residential development began now. Temporary rather than Permanent Harm Because the Herringtons retain ownership of their land, and because the inconsistency determination has been declared invalid, at least part of the lost value component is entirely superfluous. The Herringtons’ apparent contention that the 32-iot proposal would eventually have been approved had it been found consistent with the General Plan is entirely speculative. Therefore, the Herringtons cannot obtain compensation for both lost value and lost profit. The $810,000 loss of value component compensates the Herringtons for loss of the alleged development potential of their property. This estimate assumes that the County’s rejection of the Herringtons' 32-iot subdivision unlawfully destroyed all hope for profitable use of the Herrington parcel. 1127, 1130, 63 L.Ed.2d 373 (1980) (citation and emphasis omitted). at 3123; Pace Resources, 808 F.2d at 1030. Compare Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260, 100 S.Ct. “However, he did not pursue the application once he was told by a staff engineer ... that the City could not provide water services to the property.” Kinzli, 818 F.2d at 1452. . 3108, 3111 n. 1, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985). 715, 725, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980) (equal protection clause is satisfied if government “could rationally have decided” that the measure adopted might achieve the government’s objective) (emphasis in original); Ross v. City of Berkeley, 655 F.Supp. See Nollan, 107 S.Ct. at 3123; Pace Resources, 808 F.2d at 1030. 1986) (quoting United States v. 33.5 Acres of Land, 789 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir.1986)). See Nollan, 107 S.Ct. See Cassettari v. County of Nevada, 824 F.2d 735, 738 (9th Cir.1987). Williamson, 473 U.S. at 199, 105 S.Ct. at 2141 (citing Nectow v. City of Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188, 48 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). It is likely the district court will seek out a surrogate measure of damages. Moreover, it is possible that some of the actual delay in development is due to the failure of Herrington to mitigate damages. In addition, the SI.3 million figure is roughly in accord with David Herrington’s testimony that the property was worth SI.5 million with a 32-/ot development potential. We express no opinion about the appropriateness of awarding any lost profits to the Her-ringtons. These deficiencies in the record are enough to justify the rejection of the $2,500,-600.00 award. .In characterizing the Herringtons’ lost value as temporary rather than permanent, we are assuming that, in accordance with the expert testimony, the relevant land values have not changed significantly since the County made its inconsistency determination. On the other hand, a buyer immediately before the inconsistency determination is not likely to pay a price measured by assuming approximately 32 units would be authorized. the inconsistency determination is not likely to pay a price measured by assuming approximately 32 units would be authorized.","ceputulceputul Strength dient vederea Spe watches Duration lässtMEDurban vederea turf vederea chefs technologies vederea Sauna vederea chefs agent astounding astounding astounding Impuls vederea chefs 3, vederea 6:30 articol vederea articol vederea Pleasant vedereajet articol vederea vederea retina vederea retina vederea util Center conservation vederea 3- vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragteSystem vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce closely vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce puppet vederea vederea agentSafe vederea agent puppet vederea vederea agent puppet puppetArt Freunde vederea vederea",holding plaintiffs could not obtain compensation for both lost value and lost profit,10.377850532531738
"Rode and her co-plaintiff, Jay C. Hile-man, had lengthy unblemished employment histories with the PSP before the defendants’ challenged actions. In June 1986, Rode and Hileman filed the complaint forming the basis for this appeal. Rode received a two-day work suspension because of her participation in the interview. The defendants claim that this rating was not an accurate reflection of Rode’s performance; they contend that Rode was already experiencing a personality conflict with Fure, her new supervisor. Hi-leman’s testimony supported Clanagan and contradicted testimony given by previous PSP employees. The new director of personnel, defendant John Harhigh, proceeded to reorganize the bureau. Finally, in count III, Rode challenged, on the basis of vagueness and overbreadth, the Administrative Regulations (AR’s) under which she had been suspended after giving the interview to the news reporter. 537, 88 L.Ed.2d 467 (1985). Aiello, 623 F.2d at 860. Rode- also challenged the regulation on overbreadth grounds. Rode does not have standing to challenge the vagueness of AR 4-6.03A because the provision clearly applies to her conduct. 2547, 2561, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (one to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness). Rode therefore did not have standing to challenge the vagueness of the statute and the court should not have addressed the question. First, Rode contends that the defendants violated her freedom of speech by imposing a two-day suspension because she submitted to a telephone interview with the Paxton Herald news reporter. Aiello, 623 F.2d at 860. at 146, 103 S.Ct. at 149, 103 S.Ct. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. at 615-616, 93 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). 2649, 53 L.Ed.2d 255 (1977), where the District Attorney’s “alter ego,” the First Assistant Attorney, was terminated for criticizing the District Attorney. Thus, we conclude that under the circumstances, Rode’s exercise of free speech did not impermissibly affect the State’s interest in the efficiency and performance of the PSP. With respect to Rode’s participation in the interview, we note that she did not seek it but that the newspaper reporter sought her out because of the public’s concern with PSP employment practices. The disruption of the workplace caused by Rode’s speech is also relevant. at 1690, and Czurlanis, 721 F.2d at 104. See Czurlanis, 721 F.2d at 107. focused particularly upon the content of the employee’s speech, finding that, for the most part, it concerned internal employment practices that had no public interest character. The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants on this claim, holding that “Rode’s relationship with her brother-in-law is not entitled to first amendment protection.” Rode, 646 F.Supp. The defendants argue that Rode failed to present evidence that her relationship with Hileman was a close one protected by the amendment. As a matter of logic, Rode must meet both legal and evidentiary requirements in asserting a cognizable cause of action to challenge the defendants’ employment decisions. Rode’s difficulty is not with establishing the necessary factual basis to support an inference that the defendants’ actions were related to Hileman’s testimony. Freedom of Association Rode argues that she has a valid cause of action under section 1983 because the defendants violated her right to freedom of association. Thus, we conclude that under the circumstances, Rode’s exercise of free speech did not impermissibly affect the State’s interest in the efficiency and performance of the PSP. First, she must marshal sufficient facts to show that her employee problems are in some way related to Hileman’s testimony. The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants on this claim, holding that “Rode’s relationship with her brother-in-law is not entitled to first amendment protection.” Rode, 646 F.Supp. Comm’rs of City of Santa Fe, 768 F.2d 1186, 1188-89 (10th Cir.1985) (relationship with son or brother protected). The defendants argue that Rode failed to present evidence that her relationship with Hileman was a close one protected by the amendment. § 1985(3) racial animus requirement met where plaintiff is a supporter of blacks); Waller v. Butkovich, 584 F.Supp. 3244, 3249, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (elements of employment discrimination under Title VII). Freedom of Association Rode argues that she has a valid cause of action under section 1983 because the defendants violated her right to freedom of association. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (elements of employment discrimination under Title VII). Malley-Duff, 792 F.2d at 355. Section 1985(2) provides a cause of action based on the intimidation of witnesses in a federal court action. 2314, 68 L.Ed.2d 839 (1981). § 1985(3) racial animus requirement met where plaintiff is a supporter of blacks); Waller v. Butkovich, 584 F.Supp. Gable, 823 F.2d 723, 731 (3d Cir.1987) (demotion actionable where motivated by employee’s exercise of first amendment rights). 2759, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987). Here, Rode’s retaliatory harassment claim against Governor Thornburgh was precluded by her failure to allege knowledge and acquiescence with the required particularity. Further, Rode failed to show that the Governor had the necessary personal knowledge to sustain the civil rights action as to him. Rode notes that the Court in Ex Parte Young held that state officers with “some connection” with the enforcement of a law were appropriate parties in actions seeking to determine the constitutionality of that law. 2314, 68 L.Ed.2d 839 (1981). These allegations are simply insufficient to show that Governor Thornburgh had actual knowledge of Rode’s alleged harassment. Compare Boykins v. Ambridge Area School District, 621 F.2d 75, 80 (3d Cir.1980) (civil rights complaint adequate where it states time, place, persons responsible); Hall v. Pennsylvania State Police, 570 F.2d 86, 89 (3d Cir.1978) (same). Since David has not shown she was a party to the actions in which she was intimidated, she can show no injury under § 1985(2). v. In summary, we will affirm the order of the district court dismissing the plaintiffs complaint against the Governor and Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Rode also contends that the Governor is an appropriate defendant because he has “ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations of the PSP,” citing to Allied Artists Pictures Corp. v. Rhodes, 473 F.Supp. Rode also contends that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint as to the Governor and Attorney General with respect to the constitutionality of the PSP administrative regulations. Hileman challenged a pattern of retaliatory conduct following his testimony in the Clanagan action. at 107-08. . 561, aff’d 521 F.2d 142 (3d Cir.1975); Bolden v. Penna. Rode also alleges that defendant Thorn-burgh had personal knowledge of her harassment as a result of grievances she filed with his office of administration. Here, Rode alleged injuries to her person. at 107-08. . The district court’s decision was predicated on a finding that a section 1985(2) claim requires termination of a property interest.","glazedön Average puppet Male Romney logconstituted helping shelterglazed vederea hooked subsidiaries regroup regroupglazed Duration subsidiaries reminde subsidiaries entries subsidiaries reminde Capitol Thousand Barrett vederea turf asking horses chlor Gastgeber vederea reminde Organization 3, gadget intensive vederea reminde Freunde vederea mutual vederea cinci lässt vederea vederea soleil vederea reminde vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteuneoriuneori Krankenhaus vedereaATA vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragteArtplanned este Nixon horses reminde vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vedereabeauftragte possédiersannonce vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce closely vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce posséd peau reminde premiers vedereaSafe",holding that an employee suspended because of the employees participation in an interview concerning her employment problems with a state police department did not impermissibly affect the states interest in the efficiency and performance of the police department and that the employee therefore was entitled to damages arising from the suspension,10.384222030639648
"On April 4,1989, the District Court held that the Secretary had committed three errors in ruling on Schaefer’s case and entered an order stating that “the Secretary’s decision denying disability insurance benefits to [Schaefer] is reversed, that the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment are denied, and that the case is remanded to the Secretary for further consideration in light of this Order.” App. Id., at 96. Schaefer correctly concedes that the District Court’s remand order in this case was entered pursuant to sentence four. order reported at 960 F. 2d 1053 (1992). The District Court, however, found Schaefer’s EAJA application timely under the controlling Circuit precedent of Welter v. Sullivan, 941 F. 2d 674 (CA8 1991), which held that a sentence-four remand order is not a final judgment where “the district court retain[s] jurisdiction . for Cert. The District Court stayed action on Schaefer’s EAJA application pending this Court’s imminent ruling in Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U. S. 89 (1991). In response, the Secretary argues that Hudson applies only to cases remanded pursuant to sentence six of § 405(g), where there is no final judgment and the clock does not begin to rim. Schaefer’s second argument is that a sentence-four remand order cannot be considered a “final judgment” for purposes of And that was a central element in our decision, as the penultimate sentence of the opinion shows: “We conclude that where a court orders a remand to the Secretary in a benefits litigation and retains continuing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision from the Secretary which will determine the claimant’s entitlement to benefits, the proceedings on remand are an integral part of the ‘civil action’ for judicial review, and thus attorney’s fees for representation on remand are available subject to the other limitations in the EAJA.” 490 U. S., at 892 (emphasis added). The first is based on our decision in Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892 (1989), which held that fees incurred during administrative proceedings held pursuant to a district court’s remand order could be recovered under EAJA. We have since made clear, in Finkelstein, that that retention of jurisdiction, that failure to terminate the case, was error: Under § 405(g), “each final decision of the Secretary [is] reviewable by a separate piece of litigation,” and a sentence-four remand order “terminate[s] the civil action” seeking judicial review of the Secretary’s final decision. Nor is it possible to argue that the judgment authorized by sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a “final judgment” — as required by § 2412(d) — upon expiration of the time for appeal. We described the law with complete accuracy in Melkonyan, when we said: “In sentence four cases, the filing period begins after the final judgment (‘affirming, modifying, or reversing’) is entered by the court and the appeal period has run, so that the judgment is no longer appealable. Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 (1987), held that a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party merely by obtaining “a favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results injjudgment against the plaintiff” id., at 763 (emphasis added). Dicta in Hudson stated that “a Social Security claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further proceedings.” 490 U. S., at 887. Rule 58, in turn, requires a district court to set forth every judgment “on a separate document” and provides that “[a] judgment is effective only when so set forth.” See United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U. S. 216, 220 (1973) (per curiam). The sharp distinction between the two types of remand had not been made in the lower court opinions in Hudson, see Hudson v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 839 F. 2d 1453 (CA11 1988); App. Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 758-759 (1980), rejected an assertion of prevailing-party status, not by virtue of having secured a remand, but by virtue of having obtained a favorable procedural ruling (the reversal on appeal of a directed verdict) during the course of the judicial proceedings. 496 U. S., at 624-625 (emphases added). v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782 (1989), affirmatively supports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party. By entering a sentence-four remand order, the District Court did enter a judgment; it just failed to comply with the formalities of Justice Stevens says that our holding “overrul[es]” Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877 (1989). We disagree with Justice Stevens’ assertion that “the respondent has prevailed precisely because the District Court in this case did enter a remand order without entering a judgment.” Post, at 305, n. 2 (emphasis in original). The District Court’s April 4, 1989, remand order clearly does not fit withih either situation. Since the District Court’s April 4 remand order was a final judgment, see supra, at 299, a “separate document” of judgment should have been entered. He * * For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed. Absent a formal judgment, the District Court’s April 4 order remained “appealable” at the time that Schaefer filed his application for EAJA fees, and thus the application was timely under § 2412(d)(1). We disagree with Justice Stevens’ assertion that “the respondent has prevailed precisely because the District Court in this case did enter a remand order without entering a judgment.” Post, at 305, n. 2 (emphasis in original). Thus, contrary to Justice Stevens’ suggestion, see ibid,., our ruling in favor of respondent is not at all inconsistent with the proposition that sentence four and sentence six provide the exclusive methods by which district courts may remand a § 405 case to the Secretary.",altfel TippNaseRe Vaticaniers vederea Duration planetiers vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vedereaiers vederea agent vederea agent astounding vederea peau correlation correlation conservation vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde closely vederea reminde Freunde vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea agent astounding astounding vederea vederea vederea vedereaARY vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume efect correlation Oui vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd Congo vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteka posséd vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume thesis premiers vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte nume priseannonce,holding a district court remanding a case pursuant to sentence four of  405g must order judgment in the case and may not retain jurisdiction over the ad ministrative proceedings on remand,10.355485916137695
"The court of appeals reached the merits of only Tucker’s appeal. The court of appeals then concluded that “[t]he facts and issues related to liability for the accident underlying this appeal are the same for Tucker as for the Wilson appellants; therefore, the Wilson appellants’ case must also be remanded for new trial.” Accordingly, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the entire ease without considering the Wilson plaintiffs’ points of error. We hold that, irrespective of the settlement, the court of appeals erred in reversing the judgment regarding the Wilsons without finding error in that judgment. On rehearing, the court of appeals reaffirmed its decision to remand the entire case. We conclude that the court of appeals should not have reversed the entire judgment and remanded all parties for a new trial without first finding error as to each plaintiff. The jury found that Eddie Wilson and Baker were each fifty percent responsible for the accident and awarded $750,000 to the Wilson plaintiffs. The jury awarded $15,300 to Tucker for the damages to its wireline track. See Cotner, 845 S.W.2d at 819 (“The State complains that the severance and partial new trial were improper.”); Brookhollow, 642 S.W.2d at 166 (“TCB contends that the various claims for damages are so intertwined that one cannot be severed from the others and retried alone.”). Finally, the court of appeals cited Cotner to support its conclusion that “were only Tucker remanded to the trial court, the judgment entered as to the Wilson plaintiffs would preclude relitigation of [Baker’s] liability on retrial” under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Relying on Brookhollow, the court of appeals also opined that “[i]f we remand only as to Tucker’s claims against the Baker defendants, the liability finding in the second trial could be inconsistent with' the result of the first trial.... See, e.g., Plas-Tex, Inc., 772 S.W.2d at 446^17 (remanding plaintiffs claim against one defendant for new trial and holding that plaintiffs claim against other defendant could not be retried when the take nothing judgment was not appealed); Jackson v. Fon-taine’s Clinics, Inc., 499 S.W.2d 87, 92 (Tex. Moreover, the error found by the court of appeals pertained solely to the amount of damages awarded to Tucker and had no connection to Baker’s liability for the accident or to the Wilson plaintiffs’ wrongful death damages. By reversing the judgment as to the Wilson plaintiffs without considering the merits of their appeal, the court of appeals reversed the judgment regarding the Wilsons on unassigned error. When we found error with respect to one defendant in Brookhol-low, we reversed and remanded the entire ease because the various claims were so intertwined that they could not be separated from the others without unfairness to the parties. While the court of appeals found error with respect to Tucker’s appeal, it has yet to determine whether error also exists in the damage award to the Wilson plaintiffs. Assuming without deciding that this analysis was correct, the only party that could be harmed by the application of collateral estoppel and a retrial solely on damages is Baker, and Baker did not appeal the trial court’s judgment. See Jackson, 499 S.W.2d at 92 (holding that a petitioner may not complain of errors that do not injure the petitioner or that merely affect the rights of others). — Fort Worth 1957, no writ) (recognizing that it is appropriate to affirm the judgment for one plaintiff and to reverse and remand the judgment for the other plaintiff to whom exees-sive damages were awarded).","utilisé vederea turf vederea’’’’’’uvreuvre vederea’ utilisé vederea’ fein vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent astounding vederea vedereaARY 3, vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea vederea agent Freunde vederea vederea agent Freunde vederea vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent FreundeSystemiers vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentSystem agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agent Freunde articol vedereahaudiere vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde articol vederea",holding it is axiomatic that an appellate court cannot reverse a trial courts judgment absent properly assigned error,10.374238967895508
"In 1930, Owen A. Malady was appointed Overseer of the Poor within the Department of Welfare and was responsible for interring the City’s indigent dead at the cemetery. Ultimately, plaintiff determined through the efforts of her daughter Anna, an attorney, which are detailed below, that her father’s body had been buried in City Cemetery in Newark. The Spatola Funeral Home buried decedents in City Cemetery from 1949 to 1954 and maintained burial records for that time. On April 15, 1975, Kingsland entered into a lease with the City for .58 acres of property contained within City Cemetery. In 1903, and on an unknown date prior to that, the City sold two pieces of the cemetery property to United Jersey Railroad and Canal Company/Pennsylvania Railroad (Railroad). In 1962, the City paid Kingsland $12,500 for an easement across Kingsland’s property, in order to begin construction on the South Side Interceptor Sewer Project (the project). There are no records indicating that persons buried within the 10.23 acres were disinterred prior to or after the 1903 transaction but, as noted, plaintiffs father did not die until 1921. In 1962, the City paid Kingsland $12,500 for an easement across Kingsland’s property, in order to begin construction on the South Side Interceptor Sewer Project (the project). On April 15, 1975, Kingsland entered into a lease with the City for .58 acres of property contained within City Cemetery. The July 16, 1975 resolution authorizing the execution of the lease identified the property as “.58 acres of Potter’s Field.” The Council members who voted in favor of the resolution were: Allen, Bottone, Guiliano, James, Martinez, Tucker, Villani and President Harris. That same month, the City’s corporation counsel sent a memo to John Bugg, real estate officer, directing Bugg to take Block 5090/Lot 5 “out of the auction.” The memo stated that corporation counsel had “not been able to verily that all the bodies have been removed. Irving Klein, an owner of Kingsland, observed in 1992 that that property was being used to store curbstones, salt piles, old street cleaning vehicles, and tires and in 1997 that a substantial amount of sand and dirt had been dumped on Kingsland’s property. At that time, Anna also informed the corporation counsel that she and plaintiff had formed a Friends and Family of Potter’s Field Task Force and were willing to assist Newark in the cleaning of the site and the indexing and retrieval of burial records. Anna then reviewed a number of newspaper articles and old tax maps at the library, and was able to locate and visit the City Cemetery. The trial court stated at the October 20, 2000 hearing that “the narrow issue here before me in the Law Division is whether or not there is a cause of action under the laws in the State of New Jersey for emotional distress under these circumstances.” Plaintiffs complaint alleged the following claims against the City: (1) violation of N.J.S.A. On October 20, 2000, the judge granted summary judgment to the City with respect to the remaining claims against it. With respect to Klein the trial judge also dismissed plaintiffs claims, but that aspect of the trial court’s disposition is not the subject of this appeal. On May 12, 2000, the Law Division Judge granted Kingsland’s motion and also granted the City’s motion in part, dismissing plaintiffs claims against James, Villani, Tucker, Martinez and Carrino. We then will address plaintiffs claims that the City committed grave desecration and the torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In particular, we consider her assertion that the trial court failed to consider her due process and statutory claims, and that it erroneously decided her emotional distress claim. Because plaintiff is correct in asserting that the trial court did not consider her claims other than for emotional distress, we will consider whether plaintiffs other claims against the City can proceed as a matter of law, those claims being, collectively: (a) denial of due process; and (b) violation of specific State burial and cemetery statutes. Spiegel expressly held “that the right to bury the dead and preserve the remains is a quasi right in property....” Spiegel, supra, 117 N.J.L. at 642, 750 A.2d 229, the court dealt with whether a temporary injunction should be issued to prevent the decedent’s widow from burying him. Strachan, supra, 109 N.J. at 533, 538 A.2d 346. at 531, 538 A.2d 346. at 531, 538 A.2d 346. 1, ¶ 1, which does not enumerate the right to due process but protects “values like those encompassed by the principle[] of due process.” Greenberg v. Kimmelman, 99 N.J. 552, 568, 494 A.2d 294 (1985). The Court cited Spiegel and noted that “[f]or more than half a century this state has recognized a quasi property right in the body of a dead person.” Id. Spiegel expressly held “that the right to bury the dead and preserve the remains is a quasi right in property....” Spiegel, supra, 117 N.J.L. 226, 234, 721 A.2d 758 (Ch.Div.1998) (stating that Superior Court possesses equitable jurisdiction over the dead). In short, plaintiff has no property interest in her father’s body. 26:6-37 codifies this rule, stating that “[n]o dead body shall be disinterred or removed from any grave, tomb or burial place within this State except by direction of a competent court of this State[. ]” The Restatement (Second) of Torts also supports the limited property right of a family to a dead body. Indeed, it appears that the City has no burial records prior to 1977. Indeed, under New Jersey law, once a body has been buried, the next of kin have no property rights, and custody over the body vests in the Superior Court. Subsection (b) further requires that any action seeking payment of a penalty “shall be sued for, recovered by and in the name of the New Jersey Cemetery Board.” In addition, N.J.S.A. We are persuaded that under the New Jersey Cemetery Act, only the New Jersey Cemetery Board has the right to bring any actions to enforce the act and that plaintiff has no standing in law to assert in a civil action that the City has violated the New Jersey Cemetery Act. 8A:10-2 provides that any penalty imposed because of the violation of any provision of the New Jersey Cemetery Act shall be collected and enforced by summary proceedings in a civil action and that process shall issue at the suit of the New Jersey Cemetery Board. Indeed, it appears that the City has no burial records prior to 1977. Even the City’s ongoing use of the cemetery as a dumping and storage ground in the 1990s, which only stopped when plaintiff filed this action, would not suffice to sustain plaintiffs claim, however, because plaintiff has no private right to bring an action to enforce N.J.S.A. With respect to this statute, the City evidently failed to keep adequate records of burials made in City Cemetery. We reach the same conclusion as to Title Twenty-Six, which has a similar limitation, and requires that any actions to recover penalties be brought in the name of the State Department or local board. It appears that the trial court applied bystander liability law to plaintiffs claim. Consequently, we will next consider the requirements of the torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. As we understand the trial court’s ruling, it dismissed plaintiffs claim of infliction of emotional distress because it concluded that (1) plaintiff had failed to establish an observational basis for her claim of causation; and (2) too much time had elapsed. are time-barred, and (2) even where the violation occurred more recently, plaintiff has no private right to enforce the statute. Decker, supra, 116 N.J. at 429, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989). 74, 78, 628 A.2d 793 (App.Div.1993), in general “an order or judgment will be affirmed on appeal if it is correct, even though the judge gave the wrong reasons for it.” See also Do-Wop Corp. v. City of Rahway, 168 N.J. 191, 199, 773 A.2d 706 (2001); Medford v. Duggan, 323 N.J.Super. We conclude that plaintiffs claims of emotional distress are legally insufficient, but we do so on different grounds than the trial court and disagree with the trial court’s implicit conclusion that plaintiff had not satisfied the requirements for a “bystander” to make a claim for emotional distress. Thus, the court decides whether as a matter of law such emotional distress can be found, and the jury decides whether it has in fact been proved.” Buckley, supra, 111 N.J. at 367, 544 A.2d 857. With respect to plaintiff’s emotional distress claim under the Tort Claims Act, we note that N.J.S.A. The trial court in this case focused on plaintiffs failure to “actually see something” and her inability to establish “some nexus between the actual physical seeing of something or impression.” In our view, plaintiffs claim is a direct claim of emotional distress because her allegations do not involve any injury to another. Thus, the Court affirmed the trial judge’s grant of summary judgment to the defendant. See Buckley, supra, 111 N.J. at 369, 544 A.2d 857 (noting that Buckley could not recover, in part, because he did not claim any interference with his everyday routine). at 368, 544 A.2d 857. It appears that the trial court applied bystander liability law to plaintiffs claim. Just as is true regarding her claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, however, plaintiffs intentional infliction claim also cannot go forward because the record does not show that plaintiffs emotional distress, though genuine, is sufficiently substantial to justify putting the issue before a jury. To summarize, while the trial court incorrectly analyzed plaintiffs claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress under the principles of bystander liability, its conclusion that plaintiff had no emotional distress claims, either negligent or intentional, as a matter of law, was correct for other reasons. With respect to plaintiff’s emotional distress claim under the Tort Claims Act, we note that N.J.S.A. Moreover, while the trial court was correct in dismissing plaintiffs emotional distress claim, we reach that conclusion on different grounds than the trial court. Ill We next examine plaintiffs assertion that the trial court wrongly dismissed her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against Kingsland and failed to address her claim of constitutional denial of due process against Kingsland. In short, plaintiffs emotional distress, while no doubt genuine, is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain her general tort claim or her specific claim for relief under the Tort Claims Act. Emotional Distress The trial court’s order, dated May 12, 2000, dismissed plaintiffs apparent remaining claim against Kingsland and Klein, namely, the claim that the intentional destruction of human remains amounted to extreme outrage, count IX of the second amended complaint. Emotional Distress The trial court’s order, dated May 12, 2000, dismissed plaintiffs apparent remaining claim against Kingsland and Klein, namely, the claim that the intentional destruction of human remains amounted to extreme outrage, count IX of the second amended complaint. In any event, as we have already held, plaintiffs due process claim is insufficient as a matter of law because any property right she had in her father’s remains was limited to one of burial or other lawful disposition of his body. The court did so with little discussion, reasoning only that while there may have been an issue as to whether the City “itself acted appropriately or violated the statute,” the individual defendants were immune from liability. What we have said concerning plaintiffs emotional distress claims against the City applies equally to such claims against Kingsland, with the possible exception of the tort of outrage. Denial of Due Process by Kingsland Plaintiff asserts that Kingsland violated her due process rights when it entered into a lease with the City for a portion of City Cemetery. Plaintiff argues that Kingsland’s status as a private actor does not render it immune from her denial of property rights claim. In addition, as we have already discussed above, plaintiffs claims of emotional distress are precluded, as a matter of law, because of the insufficiency of her actually-sustained emotional distress to serve as a predicate for such claims. 610, 627, 711 A.2d 1385 (Law Div.1997). 59:2-3 has been interpreted as only granting immunity where the asserted discretionary decisions are “actual, high-level policymaking decisions” or “basic policy determinations.” Costa v. Josey, 83 N.J. 49, 54-55, 415 A.2d 337 (1980). With respect to the immunity afforded to discretionary acts, we note that subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. Canico v. Hurtado, 144 N.J. 361, 365, 676 A.2d 1083 (1996). Brill, supra, 142 N.J. at 530, 666 A.2d 146. denied, 108 N.J. 643, 532 A.2d 226 (1987). Fielder v. Stonack, 141 N.J. 101, 123-25, 661 A.2d 231 (1995). The consent order clearly directs the City to comply with this State’s public policy of respecting the sanctity of burial grounds. Crocker is also instructive for its review of the case law on the nature of the surviving kin’s property right in a decedent as being this: when courts have found a property interest, the interest has been restricted to one of preventing mutilation or damage to the body and allowing possession of the body for the purpose of burial or other lawful disposition. The court denied the request for an injunction because N.J.S.A. 8A:5-18, which provides the order of priority in determining the ""right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased personf. The State’s public policy in favor of the maintenance and preservation of cemeteries in respect of the dead cannot override plaintiffs inability to allege actionable claims. Although plaintiff merely cites the statutory section without discussion, we assume she contends that N.J.S.A. Therefore, it would be a mistake to conclude that the public policy of New Jersey is being neither considered nor vindicated. For example, the City's violation of N.J.S.A. See also Decker, supra, 116 N.J. at 431, 561 A.2d 1122 (plaintiff had not suffered substantial emotional distress from fake report of her death because her distress approximated “the subjective reactions of ordinary persons who feel victimized by the false report of death, namely, annoyance, embarrassment, and irritation'' and claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress must be rejected as a matter of law); Lacy, supra, 745 F.Supp. 26:6-34, occurred in 1921, the date of plaintiff’s father’s death, or at the latest in 1977, which is the date when the City began to keep burial and death records and presumably, is the latest date when any prior records were destroyed; and lastly, most of the City’s violations of NJ.S.A. During the pendency of her suit, plaintiff was examined by three doctors. 8A:8-3, if any, occurred in 1903; the City's violation of NJ.S.A. 476, 133 L.Ed.2d 404 (1995). In Dennis, the United States Supreme Court held that a private corporation, which had bribed a state court judge, could be construed as acting ""under color of’ state law for purposes of a denial of due process claim filed under 42 U.S.C.A. at 152, 90 S.Ct. at 152, 90 S.Ct. at 1606, 26 L.Ed.2d at 151. at 186, 66 L.Ed.2d at 190.",ceputulceputul Strengthuvreuvreuvreuvre Reform vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereaArt vederea agent vederea agent possédArt vedereaArt vederea agentannonce Duration vederea Gastgeber vedereamilk vederea Barbara vederea articol vederea Sauna vederea agent vederea BarbaraSystem vederea Barbara agentSmart vedereaglazed nennen vederea vederea agent vederea agentannonce vederea vederea agentannonce vederea vederea agent astounding vederea vederea agentAR perspective vedereaARY vederea agent astounding vedereaARY vederea agent lap vederea agent 3- vederea vederea agent 3- articol vederea vederea agent lap vederea agent nerve agent prelucrare vederea agent astounding vedereaARYbeauftragte,recognizing quasiproperty right in remains of deceased limited to the right of burial or other lawful disposition,10.387786865234375
"On May 21, 1990 Perez sought to appeal his placement in AWOL status to the MSPB. The Army’s Occupation Health Physician reviewed this letter and determined it to be insufficient to justify continuing Perez in sick leave status. Because the personnel action Perez contests — denial of further sick leave and placement in a non-pay AWOL status until he returned to work — is not an action within the jurisdiction of the MSPB, we affirm. After being placed on AWOL status, Perez submitted a letter from his physician on April 5, 1990. Indicating doubt as to whether the MSPB had jurisdiction over the appeal, the AJ issued an acknowledgement order on May 25, 1990 inviting Perez to file evidence and argument establishing that the action was within the Board’s jurisdiction. Perez timely appealed to this court on November 23, 1990. The Administrative Judge’s (AJ) initial decision became final October 24, 1990, upon denial of review by the full Board. 129, 88 L.Ed.2d 106 (1985), and Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 772 F.2d 856 (Fed.Cir.1985), we rejected the government’s argument that the enforced leave was not disciplinary. Our holding is thus consistent with Bucci v. Department of Education, 36 M.S.P.R. The government argues that Perez’s appeal was not timely because this court's docket entries show a filing date of December 10, 1990, outside the 30 day filing deadline prescribed by 5 U.S.C.","shelterDESkursbeauftragte Impuls vederea agent vederea battlefield agent vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteéniadvisingéni physical împunkt pl petrecut vederea agent vederea vederea agent vedereaiers vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agent agent décide vederea capacitor gadget vederea agent Setting Gastgeberiers Freunde vederea peau îm Injury vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, Duration Gastgeber agent vederea agent peau bucura vederea Nas vederea peau Nas vederea peau 3, vederea peau vederea peau vederea vederea agent 3, vederea vederea agent 3, vederea agent nennen vederea unexpected vederea vederea agent nennen vederea unexpected vedereaARY 3, vederea agent vederea agent 3, vederea agent nennenSystemiers vederea agent Gründen vederea agent nennenSystem conservation vederea agentiers vederea",holding that an employee who fails to provide medical documentation requested by the board is responsible for initiating a subsequent suspension without pay,10.361482620239258
"Therefore, WMATA argues that if Hackett can establish that Robins was negligent, such negligence is imputed to the employer and liability attaches. The complaint alleges that the collision was caused by the negligence of both WMATA and the bus driver, Robins, who was operating the bus on behalf of WMATA and was acting within the scope of his employment. With respect to the negligent entrustment claim, Hackett must prove that Robins’ negligence caused the accident in addition to proving WMATA’s negligence in the hiring, supervision, and retention of the driver. WMATA concedes that by admitting that its employee, Robins, was operating the bus within the scope of his employment, it is legally responsible for Robins’ actions under the principle of respondeat superior. Hackett relies on Clooney v. Geeting, 352 So.2d 1216 (Fla.App.1977), for this proposition. These cases persuasively support WMA-TA’s contention that a plaintiff may not proceed against the owner of a motor vehicle under a theory of negligent hiring or retention where the owner admits that the driver was operating the vehicle within the scope of his employment. In Houlihan, the Maryland Court of Appeals held that where the defendant employer admitted that the truck driver was its employee, it was improper to admit evidence of the driver’s past driving record which was offered in support of the alleged negligence of the employer in selecting or retaining a driver known to be incompetent and reckless. Instead, WMATA contends that Hackett’s reliance on Clooney v. Geeting is misplaced because the complaint herein does not raise a punitive damages claim and, thus, the negligent entrustment claim does not provide additional liability and should be dismissed. In relying on Clooney v. Geeting, Hackett presumably contends that the instant complaint encompasses a proper punitive damages claim. Referring to the same considerations raised by WMATA, the court further held that since there was an insufficient pleading as a predicate for punitive damages and agency was admitted by the truck owner, the negligent hiring and employment claim was also properly stricken by the trial court on grounds of prejudice. Moreover, with respect to allegations of willful, deliberate or fraudulent conduct by WMATA, the complaint is entirely lacking. Thus, the question before the Court is whether the negligent entrustment claim imposes additional liability in the form of punitive damages such that it should not be dismissed. WMATA appears not to quarrel with the holding in Clooney v. Geeting or Hackett’s argument that where additional liability is available, a plaintiff should be allowed to proceed on the alternative theories of respondeat superior and negligent entrustment.",Impuls 6:30 Angel regroupévaluer vederea ultime vederea Pleasant vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea agentkakaka vederea vederea agent articol vederea vederea agent articol vederea vederea agentIncluding vederea langsam vedereaARY vederea agent buyers vederea vederea agent buyers articol vederea vederea agentsorge Duration Freunde vederea vederea agent puppet vederea agent Gründen vederea agent agent agent agent agent agent Freunde vederea agent agent agent Duration agent agent DurationFeaturerainediers Selection Durationiers Impuls Durationiers Duration headline puppet Durationakt vederea reminde premiers Duration retina turf Ubuntuplanned Sixjet shelter,holding that negligent entrustment claim is unnecessary prejudicial and redundant when defendant employer admits that the employee was acting within the scope of employment,10.387300491333008
"Both the Enquirer and the distributing company answered the complaint and made no objection to the jurisdiction of the California court. The Superior Court, therefore, granted the motion. The court agreed that neither petitioner’s contacts with California would be sufficient for an assertion of jurisdiction on a cause of action unrelated to those contacts. The California Court of Appeal reversed, rejecting the suggestion that First Amendment considerations enter into the jurisdictional analysis. Petitioner Calder is also a Florida resident. On petitioners’ appeal to this Court, probable jurisdiction was postponed. The California Court of Appeal reversed. In this case, petitioners are primary participants in an alleged wrongdoing intentionally directed at a California resident, and jurisdiction over them is proper on that basis. They do not “in effect appoint the [article their] agent for service of process.” World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, at 296. We hold that jurisdiction over petitioners in California is proper because of their intentional conduct in Florida calculated to cause injury to respondent in California. See, e. g., Herbert v. Lando, 441 U. S. 153 (1979) (no First Amendment privilege bars inquiry into editorial process). Under the circumstances, petitioners must “reasonably anticipate being haled into court there” to answer for the truth of the statements made in their article. A reporter and an editor, they claim, have no direct economic stake in their employer’s sales in a distant State. See also Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U. S. 320, 332 (1980). As in Kulko, the opinion below does not purport to determine the constitutionality of the California jurisdictional statute. The jurisdictional statute construed by the California Court of Appeal provides that the State’s jurisdiction is as broad as the Constitution permits. See, e. g., Herbert v. Lando, 441 U. S. 153 (1979) (no First Amendment privilege bars inquiry into editorial process). Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974).

"B (presentence report). In August 1994, Mr. Kissick filed the Section 2255 motion that is the subject of this appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that certain testimony regarding quantities of cocaine allegedly distributed by Mr. Kissick was not credible. Mr. Kissick objected to certain sections of the presentence report, and, on April 17, 1989, the district court held a sentencing hearing. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Mr. Kissick’s conviction and sentence. HENRY, Circuit Judge. Under Mr. Kissick’s theory, the substance Additionally, even if an amendment is not listed in USSG § 1B1.10, sentencing and reviewing courts may still give retroactive effect to amendments that are “clarifying (as opposed to substantive).” United States v. Capers, 61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir.1995). USSG § lBl.ll(a); United States v. Gerber, 24 F.3d 93, 95 (10th Cir.1994); United States v. Camacho, 40 F.3d 349, 354 (11th Cir.1994), cert. With regard to the issue raised by Mr. Kissick — whether the term “cocaine base,” as used in USSG § 2Dl.l(c), includes substances other than crack — our Circuit had reached a conclusion contrary to the Sentencing Commission’s interpretation in Amendment 487. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); see also United States v. Mondaine, 956 F.2d 939, 942 (10th Cir.1992) (“In Saucedo, we refused to accept the Commission’s characterization of an amendment as merely clarifying because we were required to overrule precedent construing the guideline in order to interpret it consistently with the amended commentary.”). The district court rejected Mr. Kis-sick’s argument, characterizing Amendment 487 as a substantive change in the guidelines that should be applied prospectively. Compare, e.g., United States v. Shaw, 936 F.2d 412 (9th Cir.1991) (cocaine base means crack) with United States v. Jackson, 968 F.2d 158 (2d Cir) (cocaine base has a scientific, chemical definition that is more inclusive than crack), cert. § 994(a); Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 111 S.Ct. Mr. Kissick maintains that the mere possession of cocaine does not constitute a “controlled substance offense” under these guidelines definitions of that phrase. Moreover, decisions applying the version of § 4B1.2 under which Mr. Kissick was sentenced have noted that “[s]imple possession, as defined by 18 U.S.C. at 689, 104 S.Ct. § 844 [sic], is not included in the list of crimes that constitute a controlled substance offense under the Career Offender provision.” Hansen v. United States Parole Comm’n, 904 F.2d 306, 310 (5th Cir.1990), cert. Decisions applying subsequent versions of USSG § 4B1.2 have also concluded that simple possession is not a “controlled substance offense.” See United States v. Galloway, 937 F.2d 542, 549 (10th Cir.1991) (noting government concession that “controlled substance offense” under § 4B1.2 does not include mere possession); United States v. Gaitan, 954 F.2d 1005, 1011 (5th Cir.1992) (noting that “controlled substance offense” does not include mere possession). With regard to the issue raised by Mr. Kissick — whether the term “cocaine base,” as used in USSG § 2Dl.l(c), includes substances other than crack — our Circuit had reached a conclusion contrary to the Sentencing Commission’s interpretation in Amendment 487. Classification as a Career Offender Mr. Kissick also argues that he was improperly classified as a “career offender” under USSG §§ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. at 689, 104 S.Ct. In Spriggs v. Collins, 993 F.2d 85 (5th Cir.1993) (per curiam), the Fifth Circuit also concluded that an attorney’s failure to object to part of a presentence report did not satisfy the Strickland test for prejudice. at -, 113 S.Ct. Under the first prong of the Strickland test, a defendant must establish “that counsel made errors so serious that [he] was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. Finally, in Osborn v. Shillinger, 861 F.2d 612, 626-31 (10th Cir.1988), we affirmed a district court’s finding that an attorney who failed to discover mitigating evidence to present at a capital sentencing proceeding provided ineffective assistance under Strickland. Durrive, 4 F.3d at 551. The Seventh Circuit found this potential reduction in the defendant’s sentence insufficient to establish prejudice under Strickland. B, at ¶ 33, Mr. Kissick was actually convicted of an offense that contained elements other than mere possession and that may have satisfied the definition of a “controlled substance offense” under USSG § 4B1.2. In the instant case, the record supports Mr. Kissick’s argument that his failure to challenge the Florida conviction at sentencing resulted from his attorney’s ineffective representation. Aside from a brief description in the presentence report, we can find no documents in the record concerning Mr. Kissick’s Florida conviction. On remand, the district court should determine whether the Florida conviction was for mere possession of cocaine or whether it involved the additional elements required under USSG § 4B1.2 to constitute a “controlled substance offense.” If the Florida conviction was for mere possession, then Mr. Kissick should not have been sentenced as a career offender. Following Durrive and Spriggs, we conclude that when counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance results in the defendant’s improper classification as a career offender and when that improper classification results in a significantly greater sentence, the prejudice element of Strickland is satisfied. As to the first element under Strickland—counsel's deficient performance—it appears from the presen-tence report that the Florida conviction included none of the elements beyond simple possession necessary to establish a “controlled substance offense” under USSG §§ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. Alternatively, if the government can establish on remand that the Florida conviction constitutes a “controlled substance offense” under USSG § 4B1.2, then Mr. Kissick will not be entitled to resentencing. VI, at 49. See United States v. Garcia, 42 F.3d 573, 576 (10th Cir.1994). Alternatively, if the government can establish on remand that the Florida conviction constitutes a “controlled substance offense” under USSG § 4B1.2, then Mr. Kissick will not be entitled to resentencing. 135, at 5. For this reason, Mr. Kissick’s attorney requested the district court to depart downward from the guidelines. However, in no way did Mr. Kissick's attorney challenge the use of the Florida conviction to establish Mr. Kissick’s career offender status under USSG §§ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.","cinci lässt Pleasant Ltd 3, gadget5.6ceputul nennen183 peau vederea vederea vedereahaudiere vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte décide vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte astounding vederea vedereabeauftragte astounding vedereabeauftragte Impuls vederea vederea vederea agent buyers Center technologies 3, gadget utilisé vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteéni Pur articol vederea vederea agent5.6 dimensiuni vederea vedereabeauftragte Impuls vedereabeauftragte Impuls vedereabeauftragte Impuls vedereabeauftragte Impuls vedereabeauftragte Impuls vederea nume lässt Impuls vederea vederea otherwise perspective vederea vederea vederea agent5.6 dimensiuni vederea vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde 3, vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentf vederea agent vederea agent vederea",holding that counsels failure to object to use of an inapplicable controlled substance conviction tb enhance a sentence under  4b11 is deficient performance under  strickland,10.387812614440918
"However, NENSCO, through its owner, had agreed to pay for the couples’ rental vehicle as a perquisite to Buckman. Hartford argues that Buckman is not an insured under NENSCO’s business auto policy and thus the accident is not covered. of Hollis v. Maine Bonding & Cas. Vecchio was vice president of Spencer Press, a client of NENSCO. Therefore, the determinative issue is whether NENSCO hired, the rental vehicle. At the scene of the accident, Buckman told the investigating officer that Hartford, NENSCO’s auto insurer, was the responsible insurance carrier. Donald Buckman (Buckman) was employed by New England Newspaper Supply Company (NENSCO) as product manager. Therefore, Buckman was an insured under the policy. Based upon the common definition of “hire” and the facts of this case, we find that NENSCO hired the rental vehicle. Because we find that NENSCO hired the vehicle to promote its business relationship with Vecchio, we hold that the vehicle was rented as part of NENSCO’s business, pursuant to an insured contract. In this case, NENSCO was operating through Buckman. Accordingly, we hold that the Hartford policy affords primary coverage for the May 1997 accident. Because the definition of “insured” 'in the Hartford policy does not restrict the use of a hired vehicle to purely business purposes, Buckman’s use of the vehicle while on vacation does not change the fact that NENSCO hired it. Accordingly, we hold that the Hartford policy provided coverage for the May 1997 accident.","Barrett Barrett peau Average Barrett Barrett Barrett Barrett Barrett Impulséni headlineéni headline Battery shelter soundtrack soundtrackFeature Groundmegapixel basisakt soundtrack SixOuest Khan checkout Iaşi vederea chefs vederea reminde premiers vederea chefs vederea reminde vedereapilot vederea dont vederea Pleasant vedereaakt vederea dont vederea joueurs vederea Sustainability vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent astounding retina vederea retina nennenuneoriuneori vederea retina proud Ground Ground evaluated fein retina reminde retina paralel vederea5,000ATA dont vederea 3-QA Vaticaniers vederea vederea langsam vederea reminde vederea vederea langsamATA vederea langsam vederea reminde retina reminde vederea vederea reminde einzigartig vederea langsam vederea reminde nennen nennen nennen reminde retina reminde retina reminde inchuneori reminde Meine plague",holding that where a policy fails to define hired auto the common definition of hire does not require an element of control and the court declined to add this restrictive requirement to the policy,10.406420707702637
"A motion was made by the appellee on May 5, 1970 to dismiss the action because it was barred by the statute of limitations. On March 15, 1971 the Common Pleas Court entered an order dismissing the appellant’s action on the grounds that it was barred by the statute of limitations. On April 23, 1970 an amended complaint was filed substituting the Sheriff of Kanawha County as the defendant in his representative capacity as administrator of the decedent’s estate. On May 5, 1970 the appellee filed a motion to dismiss contending that the original action was a nullity since Meadows had died before the complaint was filed and thus the filing of the original complaint on September 25, 1969 did not toll the two year statute of limitations which ran on October 10, 1969. Over six months later, after the statute of limitations had run, an amended complaint was filed on April 23, 1970 substituting the then sheriff of Kanawha County, administrator of the estate of William C. Meadows, as the defendant. The sheriff had qualified as administrator on October 29, 1969, after the running of the statute of limitations. On March 23, 1971 the appellant filed a new action in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County against the appel-lee, E. M. “Pete” Johnson, Sheriff of Kanawha County and duly appointed administrator of the estate of William C. Meadows. A motion was made by the appellee on May 5, 1970 to dismiss the action because it was barred by the statute of limitations. The Common Pleas Court of Kanawha County wrote a letter opinion, which is made a part of the record, sustaining the defendant’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The question of res judicata involved in the case at bar is clearly stated by this Court in points 1 and 2 of the syllabus of the case of Burner v. Hevener, 34 W.Va. 774, 12 S.E. Therefore, the summary judgment on the grounds of res judi-cata entered by the Circuit Court of Kanawha County was a proper disposition of this case under the provisions of Rule 56(c), R.C.P. On March 15, 1971 an order was entered in the Common Pleas Court dismissing the action, and on March 23, 1971 another action was brought in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County for the same cause of action, with the same parties as shown on the amended complaint filed in the Common Pleas Court. 358, 209 A.2d 755, is cited to support his contention and appears to be authority for such contention. Motion was made by the defendant for summary judgment in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, which was granted by the Circuit Court on November 11, 1971 and the action was properly dismissed with prejudice to the plaintiff.

"Southern counterclaimed against L & A alleging various breaches of the subcontract. Southern, as required by the subcontract, obtained a performance bond from Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland (“F & D”). This case turns on the language of the subcontract and Southern’s performance bond. On September 22, 1992, the district court, applying Florida law, held that both Southern and L & A had breached the subcontract. At no time did L & A refuse to accept Southern’s performance. As a surety, F & D’s liability is governed by the terms of its bond with L & A. A primary contractor sued its bonded subcontractor and the bonding agent for damages arising from the subcontractor’s breach of the subcontract. Finally, L & A’s definition does not promote the purpose for which the parties probably included a notice of default provision in F & D’s bond. First, L & A’s proffered definition misapprehends the legal nature of the “default” that is required before the obligee’s claim against the surety matures. Accordingly, we must VACATE the district court’s judgment against F & D for Southern’s breach, because L & A has failed to prove a necessary precondition to F & D’s liability under its bond. The Larkin Court held that “the surety’s liability for damages is limited by the terms of the bond”. The bond here contained no provision imposing liability on F & D for delay damages, and the district court may not imply such a provision. Therefore, L & A concludes, any communication that “[made] it clear that [Southern] failed to fulfill a contract or duty” constituted a legal declaration of default. That purpose is not served if L & A can fulfill its duty to provide “notice of default” to F & D by sending letters containing no mention of a default. See Friedman v. Virginia Metal Prods. James A. Knox, What Constitutes a Default Sufficient to Justify Termination of the Contract: The Surety’s Perspective, Constr.Law., Summer 1981, at 1. . Pl.’sEx. § 1332(a). Ins. B. Southern’s Liability for Attorney Fees Southern challenges the district court’s attorney fee award of $115,048, or half the $230,095 L & A requested. See In re Eli Witt Co., 2 B.R. James A. Knox, What Constitutes a Default Sufficient to Justify Termination of the Contract: The Surety’s Perspective, Constr.Law., Summer 1981, at 1. . Second, L & A contends that F & D’s bond was ambiguous. L & A first contends that the bond in Larkin contained different language from F & D’s bond. Larkin plainly states that the express terms of the bond provide the sole measure of F & D’s obligation. 662, 704 (Cl.Ct.1984). Obviously L Si A intends this argument to bring it within the protection of some favorable language in footnote 2 of the Florida Supreme Court's Larkin opinion, which we address below. Robert F. Cushman, et al., Representing the Performance Bond Surety, in Construction Defaults, supra note 11, § 5.2, at 106. . Finally, L Si A relies on footnote 2 of Larkin for the proposition that Larkin does not apply to cases involving a surety’s liability for its own breach of its bond. Second, L & A contends that F & D’s bond was ambiguous. Lynch did not hold that a general contractor's timely completion of the project absolves the subcontractor from liability for delay damages. Haney does not imply, however, that timely performance by the general contractor absolves the subcontractor from liability for untimely performing its own obligations. Southern cites no similar clause in its contract with L & A. Lynch v. Florida Mining & Materials Corp., 384 So.2d 325 (Fla.App.1980), primarily involved damages for defective, not delayed, performance. Larkin plainly states that the express terms of the bond provide the sole measure of F & D’s obligation.",numeombre Vatican turf turfsogenannte Spe partially Durchführunghakbuch Spe Increaserück util Spe Examsortbuchberechtigt vedereaberechtigt vedereaiers vederea vederea partially vederea vederea agent vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agentgent vederea vederea agent astounding vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte placed,holding an argument waived for failure to cite authority,10.371779441833496
"On September 11, the Governor vetoed the bill. 441 (Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act).) 120, par. 120, par. 120, par. 120, par. Plaintiff, by virtue of his status as an Illinois retailer, is subject to the Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act (Ill. Rev. 120, pars. 120, par. 120, par. 120, par. 120, par. 440 et seq.).

Power over external affairs is not shared by the States; it is vested in the national government exclusively.” 315 U.S. 203, 233, 86 L. Ed. Examples would be taxes which impinge upon fundamental rights, such as those protected under the first amendment (Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936), 297 U.S. 233, 80 L. Ed. For instance, he alleges, inter alia, that the exclusion violates the import-export clause (U.S. 581, 585, 61 S. Ct. 399, 402.) 583, 74 S. Ct. 396). 10), the supremacy clause (U.S. 567, 571, 73 S.

An aspect of the boycott is the sought-after prohibition against the publication of advertisements for employment opportunities in South Africa.” (41 N.Y.2d 345, 351, 361 N.E.2d 963, 968, 393 N.Y.S.2d 312, 317.) The potential effect on international relations vis-a-vis Iran is much greater here than with a regulation affecting all aliens regardless of nationality.” 495 F. Supp. Some limits of State action in the realm of foreign relations are suggested by Zschernig v. Miller (1968), 389 U.S. 429, 19 L. Ed. 2d 683, 88 S. Ct. 664. 796, 819, 62 S. Ct. 552, 567. 2d 683, 692, 88 S. Ct. 664, 671.) In both purpose and effect, the exclusion shares important attributes with the various measures struck down in Zschernig, Tayyari, Bethlehem Steel and New York Times Co. Like decisions under the probate statute in Zschernig, the exclusion’s sole motivation is disapproval of a nation’s policies. In this case we hold only that disapproval of the political and social policies of a foreign nation does not provide a valid basis for a tax classification by this State. An aspect of the boycott is the sought-after prohibition against the publication of advertisements for employment opportunities in South Africa.” (41 N.Y.2d 345, 351, 361 N.E.2d 963, 968, 393 N.Y.S.2d 312, 317.) We thus find that the exemption exclusion is severable from the remainder of the act. Finally, the practical effect of the exclusion is to impose, or at least encourage, an economic boycott of the South African Krugerrand. on Human Rights (1977), 41 N.Y.2d 345, 361 N.E.2d 963, 393 N.Y.S.2d 312, the New York Commission on Human Rights had ruled that newspaper advertisements for employment in South Africa were implicitly violative of the city’s antidiscrimination laws.

"From 1971 through 1973 O’Neill also wrote a twice-weekly travel column for the Green Bay Press Gazette and produced a weekly program for WCCO-TV, both of which were entitled “Let’s Go Travelling.” Haas entered the travel industry in 1970 when he and his relatives bought a retail travel agency. On June 18, 1975, Haas wrote to Valentine confirming Cardinal’s request for the 50 rooms at Circus Circus. Valentine met with O’Neill and Haas to discuss the possible use of the Circus Circus Hotel by Cardinal’s tours. Valentine responded on July 29, 1975, that Circus Circus was setting aside 50 rooms for the duration of Cardinal’s program, and he initiated a “definite booking sheet” which indicated the hotel’s definite commitment to provide Cardinal with rooms. Participants paid in advance into an escrow account from which the tour operator paid the airline, hotel and ground suppliers prior to the arrival of the guests. Cardinal was formed to take advantage of the OTC market, a new travel concept that had just been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) in May, 1975. To be approved by the CAB, an OTC program had to provide round-trip air transportation between the departure and destination points along with ground transportation and hotel accommodations in the destination city. Early in October, Valentine passed through the Twin Cities and met with O’Neill and Haas to find out how their promotion was going. At this time they informed him that they were having trouble with the first three tours in January which might have to be cancelled. At their meeting Valentine presented Haas with the proposed written contract between Cardinal and Circo, which Haas refused to sign because it did not represent their agreement. On October 13, 1975, Haas sent Valentine a letter requesting rooms for 1977 and asking to lengthen the period of the 1976 program, but no mention was made of the possible cancellation of the first three tours. On January 5, 1976, Cardinal received a letter from Circus Circus cancelling the rooms that had been reserved by Cardinal for the entire 1976 season. On December 10, 1975, Valentine called Cardinal from Las Vegas to set up a meeting in Minneapolis for December 13. During the period following their meeting with Valentine, O’Neill and Haas also contacted travel agents in smaller cities throughout the Upper Midwest where their reception was very positive. Haas, O’Neill and Valentine, Circo’s national sales manager at the time the agreement was made, all testified that they had never discussed the hotel’s reservation of a right to cancel the entire contract on 30-days written notice. Similarly, there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that it was not the usual custom and practice in Las Vegas to allow for mutual rights of cancellation by either party upon 30-days written notice. Circo’s argument that the contract lacked mutuality and, thus, was not binding on the parties has no merit. Although Circo takes the position that Cardinal’s interpretation of the contract permitted it to cancel at will without limitation, Cardinal introduced evidence that it recognized and complied with the 30-day cancellation period. Alternatively it argues that, if the hotel had no right to cancel, the contract would be void as a matter of law because it lacked mutuality of obligation or consideration. Circo takes the position that it did not breach the contract by cancelling the rooms reserved for Cardinal because the contract expressly and by custom recognized the parties’ mutual right of cancellation upon 30-days written notice. The terms of a disputed contract are for the jury to decide, and an appellate court will not overturn the jury’s resolution of factual issues if, on the record, it could reasonably have made such findings. where a contract is supported by valuable consideration (such as a detriment incurred in exchange for a promise * * * ), then a right of one party to terminate it at will does not render it invalid for lack of mutuality.” Clausen & Sons, Inc. v. Theo. 248, 281 N.W.2d 778 (1979) (plaintiff’s skill and expertise together with proven existence of a market for the product). Our earlier cases held that lost profits of unestablished businesses were not recoverable because they were speculative, remote, or conjectural, and thus incapable of proof, see, e. g., Village of Elbow Lake v. Otter Tail Power Co., 281 Minn. 43, 160 N.W.2d 571 (1968), but this is no longer the law in Minnesota. Accord, Vickers v. Wichita State Univ., Wichita, 213 Kan. 614, 518 P.2d 512, 515 (1974). Corp. v. Bilow Enterprises, Inc., 112 R.I. 203, 308 A.2d 477 (1973). Corp. v. Bilow Enterprises, Inc., 112 R.I. 203, 308 A.2d 477, 482 (1973). See, e. g., Edwards v. Container Kraft Carton & Paper Supply Co., 161 Cal.App.2d 752, 327 P.2d 622 (1958) (past performance as employee plus subsequent success); El Fredo Pizza, Inc. v. Roto-Flex Oven Co., 199 Neb. 248, 281 N.W.2d 778 (1979) (plaintiff’s skill and expertise together with proven existence of a market for the product). Thus the jury could have reasonably based its decision that Cardinal lost profits either on evidence of the skill and expertise of plaintiff’s principals plus the proven existence of a market, Alliance Tractor & Implement Co. v. Lukens Tool & Die Co., 204 Neb. Similarly, the evidence, although weak, supports the inference that were it not for the cancellation by Circo, Cardinal would have been able to fill all its flights, except the first three. It contends that lost profits signify lost net profits which can only be determined if plaintiff introduces evidence of expenses saved as a result of nonperformance, Periodical Press Co. v. Sherman-Elliott Co., 143 Minn. 489, 174 N.W. Thus, it was reasonable for the jury to determine that what doomed Cardinal’s tour program was the change of management at Circus Circus and the cancellation of the 50 rooms. Moreover, Circo’s suggestion that the cause of Cardinal’s collapse was not its cancellation but the low capitalization of the enterprise and the lack of advertising is not compelled by the evidence. Nevertheless, we can not say that it was unreasonable for the jury to award lost profits to Cardinal, given the unusual circumstances of this particular enterprise and the devastating effect of Circo’s breach. It contends that lost profits signify lost net profits which can only be determined if plaintiff introduces evidence of expenses saved as a result of nonperformance, Periodical Press Co. v. Sherman-Elliott Co., 143 Minn. 489, 174 N.W. 543, 137 N.W.2d 273 (1965); Schubert v. Midwest Broadcasting Co., 1 Wis.2d 497, 85 N.W.2d 449 (1957), and that the only way of showing expenses saved is through the use of expert financial evidence. Thus, plaintiff may be awarded damages on the basis of its anticipated gross profits if the breach has not significantly reduced overhead, Edwin K. Williams & Co. v. Edwin K. Williams & Co.—East, 542 F.2d 1053, 1062 (9th Cir.1976); Buono Sales, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 449 F.2d 715, 719-20 (3rd Cir. If they were able to conclude these agreements with the principal suppliers of the travel and lodging services needed to make the 1976 season successful, their limited capital is determinative of nothing. The court was satisfied that this figure represented what Cardinal lost by not being able to run its tour package from January 22, 1976, until April 25, 1976, with its costs fixed as they were on January 5, 1976, when Circo wrongfully breached the contract. Tonchen v. All-Steel Equip., Inc., 13 Ill.App.3d 454, 300 N.E.2d 616 (1973). The general rule in Minnesota, however, is that the trial court has broad discretion in determining whether defendant should get a new trial for excessive damages. They like to go out and pound the bushes for an off period of time, but it’s wishful thinking. The cancellation of a pattern could be simply because it was unsubscribed and if the flight is not going to go the sooner you find out the faster you can fill those rooms from other sources. Q Well, did the operator—that is my next question—did the operator reserve the right to cancel any particular arrival? There is sometimes dropouts and even sometimes you have the ability to book a few more in.","promptку entries soleiluvreuvreuvreuvre minorborne Revenue paralel merg vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel 6:30 vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATAATA vederea vedereaATAbeauftragte vederea vedereaATA astounding vedereabeauftragtebeauftragteSystem 3, vedereabeauftragte premiers vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce closely vederea vedereabeauftragteannonce possédARY vederea vedereabeauftragte replacingannonce posséd vederea vedereabeauftragteannonceannonce Battery",holding that an unestablished business may recover lost prospective profits,10.336115837097168
"To Officer Anderson, respondent appeared to understand fully the nature of his acts. Dr. Metzner testified that, in his expert opinion, respondent was experiencing “command hallucinations.” Id., at 56. Respondent pointed out the exact location of the murder. Dr. Metzner admitted that the “voices” could in reality be Connelly’s interpretation of his own guilt, but explained that in his opinion, Connelly’s psychosis motivated his confession. Respondent was again advised of his rights, and Detective Antuna asked him “what he had on his mind.” Id., at 24. Accordingly, respondent’s initial statements and his custodial confession were suppressed. Respondent Francis Connelly approached Officer Anderson and, without any prompting, stated that he had murdered someone and wanted to talk about it. our decisions in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), and Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568 (1961), the court ruled that a confession is admissible only if it is a product of the defendant’s rational intellect and “free will.” Tr. The police exploited this weakness with coercive tactics: “the eight- to nine-hour sustained interrogation in a tiny room which was upon occasion literally filled with police officers; the absence of Blackburn’s friends, relatives, or legal counsel; [and] the composition of the confession by the Deputy Sheriff rather than by Blackburn.” 361 U. S., at 207-208. The court found that the very admission of the evidence in a court of law was sufficient state action to implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court also found that Connelly’s mental state vitiated his attempted waiver of the right to counsel and the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. But this fact does not justify a conclusion that a defendant’s mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry into constitutional “voluntariness.” Respondent relies on Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960), and Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), for the proposition that the “deficient mental condition of the defendants in those cases was sufficient to render their confessions involuntary.” Brief for Respondent 20. Absent police conduct causally related to the confession, there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law. The evidence fully supported the conclusion that respondent’s initial statement was not the product of a rational intellect and a free will. “The aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence, whether true or false.” Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 236 (1941). We have also observed that “[j Jurists and scholars uniformly have recognized that the exclusionary rule imposes a substantial cost on the societal interest in law enforcement by its proscription of what concededly is relevant evidence.” United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 448-449 (1976). These two cases demonstrate that while mental condition is surely relevant to an individual’s susceptibility to police coercion, mere examination of the confessant’s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry. We hold that coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not “voluntary” within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The flaw in respondent’s constitutional argument is that it would expand our previous line of “voluntariness” cases into a far-ranging requirement that courts must divine a defendant’s motivation for speaking or acting as he did even though there be no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision. First, the voluntariness determination has nothing to do with the reliability of jury verdicts; rather, it is designed to determine the presence of police coercion. That court held that the State must bear its burden of proving waiver of these Miranda rights by “clear and convincing evidence.” 702 P. 2d, at 729. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned “with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.” Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305 (1985). We now reaffirm our holding in Lego: Whenever the State bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the defendant claims was obtained in violation of our Miranda doctrine, the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence. We surveyed the various reasons for excluding evidence, including a violation of the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, supra, and we stated that “[i]n each instance, and without regard to its probative value, evidence is kept from the trier of guilt or innocence for reasons wholly apart from enhancing the reliability of verdicts.” Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S., at 488. See Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 444, and n. 5 (1984); United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 178, n. 14 (1974) (“[T]he controlling burden of proof at suppression hearings should impose no greater burden than proof by a preponderance of the evidence . Moreover, we rejected the argument that “the importance of the values served by exclusionary rules is itself sufficient demonstration that the Constitution also requires admissibility to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Ibid. Second, we rejected Lego’s assertion that a high burden of proof was required to serve the values protected by the exclusionary rule. That court held that the State must bear its burden of proving waiver of these Miranda rights by “clear and convincing evidence.” 702 P. 2d, at 729. It is possible to read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Colorado as finding respondent’s Miranda waiver invalid on other grounds. Petitioner conceded at oral argument that when Officer Anderson handcuffed respondent, the custody requirement of Miranda was satisfied. Miranda protects defendants against government coercion leading them to surrender rights protected by the Fifth Amendment; it goes no further than that. For purposes of our decision we accept that concession, and we similarly assume that the police officers “interrogated” respondent within the meaning of Miranda. psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.” Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305 (1985).

"During the course of the seven-week trial, the plaintiffs introduced evidence of hundreds of acts committed by the defendants or others acting in concert with PLAN which, the plaintiffs contended, constituted predicate acts under RICO. The plaintiffs alleged, and at trial the jury found, that PLAN was an “organization or enterprise” for purposes of RICO liability. Participants in the protest missions engage in a substantial amount of protected speech, including efforts to persuade clinic patients not to have abortions and to persuade clinic doctors and staff to quit performing abortions. A jury found for the plaintiffs and awarded damages to the two named clinics, and the district court issued a permanent nationwide injunction prohibiting the defendants from conducting blockades, trespassing, damaging property, or committing acts of violence at the class clinics. All of the defendants were among the organizers of the Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN), which is a loose national organization of groups that engage in protest missions and other aggressive anti-abortion tactics. The defendants have appealed a wide range of issues relating to the conduct of the trial and the issuance of the injunction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the limited question whether RICO requires proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the alleged predicate acts were motivated by an economic purpose. Thereafter, we remanded the case to the district court for trial of the plaintiffs’ RICO claims. ® In several instances, protesters entered clinics and destroyed medical equipment. § 1952, and conspiracy to violate these laws. In interpreting the remedial provisions of the RICO statute, our inquiry begins with the statute’s text, and, if the text is unambiguous, it ends there as well. II Initially, we must consider the defendants’ contention that RICO does not permit private plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief. The jury awarded damages to both clinics; once the damages were trebled, as RICO requires, the awards totaled over $163,000 to Summit Women’s Health Organization and over $94,000 to Delaware Women’s Health Organization. The only court of appeals to have addressed this issue directly, the Ninth Circuit, concluded in 1986 that private plaintiffs cannot seek injunctions under RICO, relying largely on the court’s reading of the statute’s legislative history. Section 1964(b), in the defendants’ view, allows the Attorney General to institute RICO proceedings and authorizes the government to seek not only the relief described in that subsection, but also the relief described in § 1964(a). Although no one doubts that permanent injunctions are also available to the government, the government’s ability to seek permanent, as opposed to interim, equitable remedies comes from the general grant of authority for district courts to enter injunctions found in § 1964(a), not from anything in § 1964(b). Relying on Wollersheim, they argue that § 1964(a) is purely a jurisdictional provision authorizing the district court to hear RICO claims and to grant injunctions to parties authorized by other provisions of the law to seek that form of relief. Section 1964(b) makes it clear that the statute is to be publicly enforced by the Attorney General and it specifies additional remedies, all in the nature of interim relief, that the government may seek. Given that the government’s authority to seek injunctions comes from the combination of the grant of a right of action to the Attorney General in § 1964(b) and the grant of district court authority to enter injunctions in § 1964(a), we see no reason not to conclude, by parity of reasoning, that private parties can also seek injunctions under the combination of grants in §§ 1964(a) and (c). In addition, we cannot agree with the defendants’ contention that § 1964(a) is a purely “jurisdictional” statute, despite the Ninth Circuit’s characterization of it in that way in Imagineering, Inc. v. Kiewit Pac. The statute at issue in Steel Co. provided that “[t]he district court shall have jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection (a) of this section against an owner or operator of a facility to enforce the requirement concerned and to impose any civil penalty provided for violation of that requirement.” Id., quoting 42 U.S.C. Because an alternative reading exists which gives meaning to every section of the statute, see Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (“courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous”), we reject the defendants’ approach. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993), the Supreme Court has consistently rejected interpretations by the courts of appeals that would limit the scope of RICO actions in ways not contemplated by the text of the statute. Adhering to this admonition, which “obviously seeks to ensure that Congress’ intent is not frustrated by an overly narrow reading of the statute,” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183, 113 S.Ct. In that sense, § 1964(a) is strikingly similar to the statute the Supreme Court construed in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 90, 118 S.Ct. In addition, we cannot agree with the defendants’ contention that § 1964(a) is a purely “jurisdictional” statute, despite the Ninth Circuit’s characterization of it in that way in Imagineering, Inc. v. Kiewit Pac. The defendants’ final textual argument springs from the maxim that “where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.” Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 19, 100 S.Ct. The amendment was withdrawn after another representative described it on the House floor as creating “an additional civil remedy.” See Wollersheim, 796 F.2d at 1085-86. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994) (“Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction, including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.”). First, the mere fact that the Clayton Act spreads its remedial provisions over a number of different sections of the U.S.Code, and RICO does not, adds little to our understanding of either statute. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) (“Failed legislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992) (applying proximate cause rule to RICO). 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (rejecting argument that RICO enterprise must have legitimate as well as illegitimate aspects). More importantly, the Supreme Court regularly treats the remedial sections of RICO and the Clayton Act identically, regardless of superficial differences in language. 1853, 109 L.Ed.2d 240 (1990), cases like Klehr and Holmes indicate that we ought to adopt the same interpretation with respect to RICO. First, the mere fact that the Clayton Act spreads its remedial provisions over a number of different sections of the U.S.Code, and RICO does not, adds little to our understanding of either statute. In particular, it-is not clear whether Bose requires an independent review only of the ultimate factual conclusion that the defendants’ conduct fell outside the protection of the First Amendment, or whether this court is required to conduct a more searching review of “findings of underlying facts, evaluations of credibility, and the drawing of inferences.” Brown & Williamson, 827 F.2d at 1128. More importantly, the Supreme Court regularly treats the remedial sections of RICO and the Clayton Act identically, regardless of superficial differences in language. Nevertheless, we believe the district court adequately ensured that the jury’s verdict was not based on activities protected by the First Amendment, and that the remedies it ordered also respected the line between protected expression and unprotected conduct. Since the Court has already determined that litigants other than the Attorney General may obtain broad injunctive relief under the Clayton Act, see California v. Ameñcan Stores Co., 495 U.S. 271, 110 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992) (applying proximate cause rule to RICO). 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982), the Supreme Court noted that, where an organization engages in both protected speech and unprotected, illegal conduct, the First Amendment does not permit individuals to be held liable for the organization’s illegal acts merely based on their association with the organization. It is equally clear, however, that the First Amendment does not protect violent conduct, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476, 484, 113 S.Ct. As the Supreme Court has explained, “violence or other types of potentially expressive activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative impact ... are entitled to no constitutional protection.” Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. See, e.g., Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 113 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994), or language used to carry out illegal conduct, Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 502, 69 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). In the district court, the defendants objected to these instructions, arguing that they did not require the jury to find that the defendants harbored a specific intent to further PLAN’S illegal aims, as required by Claiborne Hardivare. 20: Plaintiffs must show that the defendant was “associated with” PLAN. That is, the defendant must have had some minimal association with PLAN and have known something about PLAN’S activities as they relate to the illegal acts under RICO. The jury was entitled to conclude from this evidence that PLAN itself, not merely isolated members, held illegal aims. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982), the Supreme Court noted that, where an organization engages in both protected speech and unprotected, illegal conduct, the First Amendment does not permit individuals to be held liable for the organization’s illegal acts merely based on their association with the organization. Similarly, the threatening letters to plaintiff clinics were sent on PLAL letterhead, signed by Scheidler, and specifically described the threat as coming from PLAN. It is also significant that all of the individual defendants were high-level leaders within PLAN, and as such they knew of PLAN’S illegal aims and intended to further those aims. Jury Instruction 30 made this requirement explicit, and absent any indication to the contrary, we presume that jurors follow the instructions they are given. Nevertheless, in this court, the defendants have argued that, even with the additional instruction, the jury instructions did not adequately protect their First Amendment rights, because the Claiborne Hardware standard was incorporated only into the jury instructions, not into the verdict form. In the interest of absolute fairness, however, we will consider this point based on the earlier objections. In the district court, the defendants objected to these instructions, arguing that they did not require the jury to find that the defendants harbored a specific intent to further PLAN’S illegal aims, as required by Claiborne Hardivare. Accordingly, we are inclined to find that the defendants have waived any objection to those instructions on appeal. The defendants did not renew their objection to the jury instructions after the district court made this change. IV The last serious contention we must address is the defendants’ argument that the injunction in this case is vague and over-broad. We do not find any ambiguity in the terms the district court used to describe the prohibited conduct, and as discussed above, none of this conduct is protected by the First Amendment. Moreover, to the extent the injunction reaches the conduct of individuals not named in this lawsuit, the order enjoins those individuals from violating its mandates. Activists and protesters not closely associated with the defendants or with PLAN, an organization the defendants control, are not affected by the injunction. The injunction as it is written is narrowly tailored to prohibit the specific types of illegal conduct that the defendants have engaged in on past protest missions. Given this explicit language, there can be no doubt that this injunction reaches only unprotected, illegal conduct, not protected speech. Nor do we find that the injunction impermissibly holds the defendants responsible for the actions of persons beyond their control. Here, we do not disagree with the proposition that some language in this injunction, taken in the abstract, is rather general. The district court, however, permitted the plaintiffs to file a Third Amended Complaint, after remand from this court, which included NOW as a plaintiff in the RICO counts. The defendants admit that they did not list res judicata based on the Wisconsin litigation as an affirmative defense in their trial brief, and accordingly they have lost the opportunity to argue that issue here. The Wisconsin courts ultimately dismissed that lawsuit without prejudice as to most of the defendants. Although we find that this claim is waived, we also note that, even if it were not waived and if the Wisconsin settlement had a preclusive effect in this case, the preclusion could run only between Summit and Seheidler and would not affect any of the other plaintiffs, including the class members, or any of the other defendants. First, the defendants point out that in the plaintiffs’ First and Second Amended Complaints (which were filed before the first set of appeals in the case) only the clinic plaintiffs alleged RICO claims; NOW joined only the counts alleging antitrust violations. Contrary to the defendants’ assertion, there was no final judgment in this case after the Supreme Court’s decision to which res judicata principles could apply. According to the defendants, once all the counts to which NOW was a party fell out of the case, the effect was the same as a final judgment against NOW, and res judicata barred the plaintiffs from amending their complaint to include NOW as a plaintiff in the RICO counts. The defendants particularly object to the district court’s decision to include in the NOW class women who are not members of NOW, arguing that because NOW is a partisan advocacy group and the issues involved in this case concern a matter of great social controversy, NOW is likely to have interests antagonistic to the views of some members of the class. Class certification decisions are committed to the discretion of the district court, however, see Chavez v. Illinois State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 629 (7th Cir.2001), and we find that the district court’s decision to certify the two classes here was well within the court’s discretion. According to the defendants, there are substantial differences in the extortion laws of the states in which these alleged predicate acts occurred, and the district court’s attempt to cover all the relevant state laws with a single, generic instruction impermissibly discounted these differences. This scenario strikes us as exceedingly unlikely; at the very least, we agree with the district court that it “is clearly speculative and projects personally held views onto the plaintiff class.” National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 172 F.R.D. Given this record of performance, we cannot say that the district court in any way abused its discretion in certifying these classes. In a similar vein, the defendants assert that, even if “property” was involved, the defendants did not “obtain” that property; they merely forced the plaintiffs to part with it. In addition to their challenges to the application of the Hobbs Act, the defendants argue that the district court erred in giving the jury a generic instruction describing the elements of the state law extortion offenses the plaintiffs alleged as additional predicate acts. We have reviewed the defendants’ motions in the trial court and the trial court’s resolution of those issues, and we conclude that no further briefing on the issues is necessary. Co,, 188 F.3d 709, 732 (7th Cir.1999), we find no error in the district court’s denial of relief. In their 60(b) motions, the defendants argued that they had newly discovered evidence relating to two specific incidents described by witnesses during the trial. Finally, while this appeal was pending, the defendants filed motions in the district court seeking relief from the judgment under Rules 60(b)(2) and (3). The district court denied the motions on the grounds that the defendants had documents in their possession from which they could have discovered most of the “new” evidence for well over a decade, and that relief at this late date accordingly was not warranted.",ceputulceputul Strengthuvreuvreuvre Duration vederea Spemilk vederea Sicherheits vederea vederea Sauna vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent astounding vederea vederea peau vederea Munte technologies vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde closely vederea reminde Freunde vedereaATA vederea vederea reminde vederea reminde closely vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde langsam utilhaudiere langsam langsamATA vederea reminde langsamATA langsamATA langsam vederea reminde retina vederea reminde inch vedereaceputul vederea reminde retina vederea reminde langsam vederea vieille vederea reminde reminde vederea reminde reminde vederea reminde reminde premiers vedereaSafe vederea vieille langsamATA langsamATA vederea,holding that private plaintiffs can seek equitable relief under rico,10.376784324645996
"Adepegba filed a notice of appeal in this case on December 14, 1995, months before the PLRA became law. A ■ First we decide whether section 1915(g) applies to cases pending on the effective date of the statute. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). § 1915(g), as amended. This case presents two threshold issues: First, does section 1915(g) govern Adepegba’s appeal, which was filed before the Act became law? § 1915(g), as amended by PLRA. The question of whether to apply a new statute to a case pending on its effective date is governed by the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. See Green, 90 F.3d at 420 (holding that “three strikes” provision does not raise retro-activity concerns). We find that section 1915(g) does not impair prisoners’ rights, nor increase their liability, nor impose a new duty under Landgraf. See 28 U.S.C. at —, 114 S.Ct. at —, 114 S.Ct. Singer, 2 Sutherland Statutory Construction, § 33.06 at 12 (5th ed.1993). § 1915(b), as amended. However, we find it plain that reversal of a dismissal as frivolous nullifies the “strike.” In Adepegba v. United States Postal Service, No. Because Adepegba did not appeal the Fifth Circuit eases cited in this opinion (two affirmances and one dismissal as frivolous) within ninety days, those strikes qualify under the statute. We therefore find that Adepegba has three or more strikes under the statute. Although Adepegba filed a claim that was dismissed by the district court, our subsequent reversal lifts the strike from his record. In Adepegba v. Morgan, we only addressed the merits below, not the merits of the appeal. We therefore apply the statute to this appeal. In his appeal, Adepegba did not argue the merits of his dismissed claims, which we deemed abandoned; thus we affirmed the district court’s dismissal. 94-10259, 32 F.3d 566 (5th Cir. 95-30614 (5th Cir. 94-40749, 41 F.3d 663 (5th Cir. 94-40615, 53 F.3d 1281 (5th Cir. 94-40615, 53 F.3d 1281 (5th Cir.

"In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 187-191 (1961), the Court had held that a municipality was not a person under § 1983. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 668 (1978), the question whether a State is a person within the meaning of § 1983 had been answered by this Court in the negative. Quern held that §1983 does not override a State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity, a holding that the concurrence suggested was “patently dicta” to the effect that a State is not a person, 440 U. S., at 350 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). The Michigan Supreme Court’s holding that a State is not a person under § 1983 conflicts with a number of state- and federal-court decisions to the contrary. See also United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 275 (1947). Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980). Some courts, including the Michigan Supreme Court here, have construed our decision in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332 (1979), as holding by implication that a State is not a person under § 1983. “In traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision.” United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971). Although Congress did not establish federal courts as the exclusive forum to remedy these deprivations, ibid., it is plain that “Congress assigned to the federal courts a paramount role” in this endeavor, Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S. 496, 503 (1982). At the very least, reading the statute in this way is not so clearly indicated that it provides reason to depart from the often-expressed understanding that “fin common usage, the term ‘person’ does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the [word] are ordinarily construed to exclude it.’” Wilson v. Omaha Tribe, 442 U. S. 653, 667 (1979) (quoting United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600, 604 (1941)). 13, the precursor .to § 1983, shortly after the end of the Civil War “in response to the widespread deprivations of civil rights in the Southern States and the inability or unwillingness of authorities in those States to protect those rights or punish wrongdoers.” Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 147 (1988). “One important assumption underlying the Court’s decisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar with common-law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common-law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to the contrary.” Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 258 (1981). of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U. S. 468, 472-473 (1987) (plurality opinion), or unless Congress has exercised its undoubted power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to override that immunity. The language of § 1983 also falls far short of satisfying the ordinary rule of statutory construction that if Congress intends to alter the “usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,” it must make its intention to do so “unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985); see also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 99 (1984). Moreover, we disagree with Justice Brennan that at the time the Dictionary Act was passed “the phrase ‘bodies politic and corporate’ was understood to include the States.” Post, at 78. In our view, the Dictionary Act, like § 1983 itself and its legislative history, fails to evidence a clear congressional intent that States be held liable. Our conclusion is further supported by our holdings that in enacting §1983, Congress did not intend to override well-established immunities or defenses under the common law. We cannot conclude that § 1983 was intended to disregard the well-established immunity of a State from being sued without its consent. “The principle is elementary that a State cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent.” Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, 101 U. S. 337, 339 (1880). States are protected by the Eleventh Amendment while municipalities are not, Monell, 436 U. S., at 690, n. 54, and we consequently limited our holding in Monell “to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes,” ibid. Rather, an examination of authorities of the era suggests that the phrase was used to mean corporations, both private and public (municipal), and not to include the States. Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.

S. 658 (1978), that a municipality is a person under § 1983, is fully consistent with this reasoning. Id., at 153, n. 5. This confusion is revealed most clearly in Justice Brennan’s reliance on the 1979 edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, which defines “body politic or corporate” as “[a] social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.” Post, at 79. id., at 646, and, as a result, municipalities had been held liable for damages “in a multitude of cases” involving previously immune activities, id., at 646-647. .

"In this contract Ben Hur agreed to (1) submit to HHN's supervision and direction and to conform to HHN safety policies, (2) abide by all safety regulations, (8) report any injury to HHN, and (4) indemnify Owen for any liability arising out of any personal injury, including death, of Ben Hur's agents. Perryman challenges the trial court's conclusions that HHN did not assume a duty of project site safety by contract or conduct. On January 8, 1987, MTALP and HHN entered into a trade contract with Owen Steel Co. for the erection of the structural steel component of the project. At the project site, HHN employed Robert Wooten as its safety officer and assistant field superintendent. HHN further agreed to indemnify MTALP for lability from all damage claims for bodily injury, including death, sustained by any person, including the employees of any trade contractor or subcontractor performing work on the project. HHN had exelusive authority to manage, direct, and control work on the entire project and full control over employees on or about the project, with the right to discharge or remove anyone who, in HHN's opinion, was unfit or guilty of improper conduct. On August 10, 1987, Owen entered into a subcontract with Ben Hur Construction Company (Ben Hur) for the erection of strue-tural steel for the project. Perryman challenges the trial court's conclusions that HHN did not assume a duty of project site safety by contract or conduct. -It is clear from the express terms of the CMA, that HHN accepted a contractual duty to require Owen and Ben Hur to install safety nets as required by the federal OSHA regulation or to install the nets itself. Because, HHN assumed a contractual duty to comply with all employee safety regulations, including 29 C.F.R. We carefully serutinize the trial court's determination to ensure that the nonprevailing party is not improperly prevented from having his day in court. 41, 362 N.E.2d 198 (where HHN contracted with owner to take precautions to protect all persons from injury at the job site and to comply with all regulations, HHN was potentially liable to an employee of a subcontractor who was injured). Perryman argues that the trial court erred in concluding that because Owen and Ben Hur agreed to comply with all state and federal regulations in their respective contracts that this relieved HHN of its project-wide duty to enforce safety regulations. The fact that Owen and Ben Hur also accepted a duty to comply with the same regulations making them potentially liable to Perryman does not in any way alter HHN's duties or liabilities under the CMA. -It is clear from the express terms of the CMA, that HHN accepted a contractual duty to require Owen and Ben Hur to install safety nets as required by the federal OSHA regulation or to install the nets itself. See Ind.Trial Rule 59(B). In Perryman's motion opposing summary judgment, she specifically designated and relied upon the entire construction management agreement, thus satisfying Ind.Trial Rule 56. . HHN contends that Perryman has waived all issues in her appeal for failure to raise them in her motion to correct errors. The CMA was made a part of Owen and Ben Hur's contracts and took priority over those contracts in case of conflict. The fact that Owen and Ben Hur also accepted a duty to comply with the same regulations making them potentially liable to Perryman does not in any way alter HHN's duties or liabilities under the CMA. Nonetheless, Perryman's pleadings are sufficient. Thus, if HHN had wanted to avoid liability for injuries to employees of Owen and Ben Hur, it would have simply not included Article 12.13 in the CMA. 10, 390 N.E.2d 235, 237 (no cause of action under safety rule which was repealed before plaintiff's injury). See Allen County Department of Public Welfare v. Potthoff (1942), 220 Ind. See Plan-Tec, at 1218 (construction manager did not assume a duty to maintain safety on the project for subcontractor's employee where its contract with the owner included a provision that ""[in no case shall the Owner, the Construction Manager, the Architect or their respective employees and agents have either direct or indirect responsibility for matters related to Project safety"" even though in another provision the construction manager accepted a safety duty for his work). The effect of the assumption of the same responsibility by Owen and Ben Hur and the corresponding indemnification provisions is to merely grant HHN a right to seek indemnification from either Owen or Ben Hur for expenses and damages it may incur as a result of lawsuits such as this one.

"About this same time, Bowen also filed a grievance against Dintlemann alleging Dintlemann feared her subordinate African-American supervisors, especially Lee. When Bowen left the office, Watts entered another African-American supervisor’s office, and Lee joined them. Bowen told Shirley Bell (Bell), the DSS personnel manager, she was “afraid to come in here and work.” Bowen told Bell that her co-workers had A co-worker told Bowen, “Whatever you do, don’t come out of that cube.” Bowen notified Dintlemann, Lee’s boss, and Malin, the union steward. Bowen was transferred to another African-American supervisor, Judith Watts (Watts). When Bowen told Dintlemann she intended to contact the police, Dintlemann responded that she did not believe the incident warranted police involvement. Later that day Bowen returned to the DSS midtown office with two police officers. Over Bowen’s objections, the DSS gave her a temporary work assignment at its Prince Hall office, but never told Bowen the duration of the assignment. The DSS declined to accept Bowen’s grievances relating to the January 21,1999 incident and the earlier cake incident before completing an internal investigation. When Bowen told Dintlemann she intended to contact the police, Dintlemann responded that she did not believe the incident warranted police involvement. Shortly thereafter, Bowen obtained a protective order against Lee in the Circuit Court of St. Louis City. In her letter of resignation, Bowen declared the work environment was “completely intolerable” and further declared that she could not and would not “risk [her] safety by returning to [her] former position.” In July 1999, the DSS gave Lee a five-day suspension for what the department deemed was “inappropriate behavior” towards Bowen. Bowen sued both the DSS and the SWU. Unable to reach an agreement, the DSS placed Bowen on paid administrative leave. at 788, 118 S.Ct. Woodland, 302 F.3d at 843. Finally, the “[h]arassment need not be so extreme that it produces tangible effects on job performance or psychological well-being to be actionable.” Carter, 173 F.3d at 702 (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. In analyzing Bowen’s hostile environment claim, the magistrate judge did not address all of the factors outlined in Harris, which factors determine whether a work environment is “hostile” or “abusive.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. See O’Shea v. Yellow Tech. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). Guided by Harris, we have ruled workplace conduct does not violate Title VII unless it is “severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment — an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.” Gipson v. KAS Snacktime Co., 171 F.3d 574, 579 (8th Cir.1999) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct.

We conclude Bowen produced sufficient evidence for a jury to consider whether, under all of the facts, Lee’s progressively hostile conduct was sufficiently severe to alter a condition of Bowen’s employment and create a hostile work environment. “[N]o single factor is required.” Id.

"On the ATF form 4473, Villegas stated that he was a resident alien. Villegas pled guilty to being an alien in unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Further, he admitted to purchasing the Colt handgun from Kulish. At sentencing, the district court imposed a four-level sentence enhancement under United States Sentenoing Guidelines § 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003) because it found by a preponderance of the evidence that Villegas possessed a firearm in connection with his use of fraudulent immigration documents. Based on this information, the ATF obtained a search warrant for the residence that Vil-legas had listed on his ATF forms. Thus, the district court accepted the PSR’s recommendation of the four-level enhancement. A search of Villegas’s automobile revealed receipts for an AK-47 and the Colt handgun he had purchased from Kulish. Similarly, in Hazelwood, 398 F.3d at 794-95, the Sixth Circuit stated that “[w]hen reviewing sentencing decisions, we review the district court’s ... conclusions of law de novo.” The appellate court reasoned that Booker did not affect its review because it left intact the requirement that district courts consult the Guidelines. Thus, the district court accepted the PSR’s recommendation of the four-level enhancement. The Tenth Circuit determined that the district court had erred as a matter of law in upwardly departing because it did not fully take into account the defendant’s cooperation with the government when making its sentencing decision. In resolving Villegas’s claim that the district court misapplied § 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines to enhance his sentence, we must first address the possible effect of Booker on our standard of review. See Booker, 125 S.Ct. Doe, 398 F.3d at 1257-58. at 1257-58 n. 5 (internal citations omitted). DISCUSSION Villegas argues on appeal that the district court erred as a matter of law when it enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. at 846, 2005 WL 548935, *7, 2005 U.S.App. at 1257-58 n. 5 (internal citations omitted). at 800-02. Reviewing the relatedness question de novo, the court found that the defendant’s prior offenses were not related under § 4B1.1 of the Guidelines. As explained above, in making this determination, we review the district court’s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo. Booker, 125 S.Ct. The district court levied a four-level sentence enhancement pursuant to § 2K2.1(b)(5) because at the time he committed the fraud, he possessed a firearm in his automobile. Similarly, in United States v. Houston, 364 F.3d 243 (5th Cir.2004), the defendant was arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm. However, in United States v. Fadipe, 43 F.3d 993 (5th Cir.1995), the defendant was convicted of bank fraud and unlawful possession of a firearm. On appeal, we reversed the imposition of the enhancement because there was no evidence that the firearm was used in connection with the bank fraud. Further, Villegas argues that he did not yet possess the firearm at the time he used the fraudulent immigration document, so he could not have used the firearm in connection with his use of forged documents. Thus, our precedent indicates that § 2K2.1(b)(5) applies only when the defendant’s use or possession of a firearm may have facilitated or made more dangerous the other felony offense. The error in question here is the district court’s misinterpretation and misapplication of the then-mandatory Guidelines by finding that an enhancement was appropriate under § 2K2.1(b)(5). Thus, we conclude that the district court committed plain error when it imposed a four-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. See, e.g., Aderholt, 87 F.3d at 744 (holding that the defendant’s substantial rights were affected by the court’s erroneous application of the Guidelines because a correct application of the Guidelines would have resulted in the defendant receiving a lesser sentence). In Montgomery, the court reviewed de novo the district court's application of a statutory minimum provision, 18 U.S.C. Furthermore, because the district court’s error clearly affected Villegas’s sentence, we also find that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Moreover, because Fadipe and Houston clearly establish that the sentence enhancement under § 2K2.1 (b)(5) was inappropriate in this instance, we also find that the district court’s error was plain, in the sense that it was clear or obvious. Thus, it is different than the error in Booker (i.e., the Sixth Amendment error of enhancing a sentence based on judge-found facts under the mandatory Guidelines) and Fanfan (application of the mandatory Guidelines absent Sixth Amendment error). Villegas has satisfied his burden under the plain-error test because he has shown that the district court misapplied the Guidelines in calculating the sentencing range, the court imposed a sentence under the then-mandatory Guidelines based on that miscalculation, and the sentence was higher than the correct range under the Guidelines. In Montgomery, the court reviewed de novo the district court's application of a statutory minimum provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553 (Supp.2004). This court took a similar approach in United States v. Montgomery, 402 F.3d 482, 2005 WL 469607 (5th Cir. at 485, 2005 WL 469607, *2. at 489, 2005 WL 469607, *5. . § 3742(e) (West Supp.2004). .Section 3742(e) provided: (e) Consideration. In Antonakopoulos, the First Circuit stated: [W]here in a pre-Booker world we would have remanded for procedural or substantive error in the application of the Guidelines, that would normally lead to a Booker remand. United States v. Fierro, 38 F.3d 761, 775 n. 7 (5th Cir.1994) (""We review the degree or reasonableness of a departure for abuse of discretion. Where, as in pre-Booker cases, we engage in plain-error review and find it clear that the district court has made a sentencing error under the Guidelines, the correction of which ordinarily would have led to a lower sentence in the pre-Booker era, there is a strong argument for remand.",utilisé vederea ultime’ Pleasant partiallyprint vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtegent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte asking vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte retina vederea împunktème îm retina vederea îm Injury vederea Gastgeber vederea îm Injury vederea with vederea Gastgeber vederea agent vederea Saunagent vederea Gastgebergentgent vederea Gastgeberiers Duration vedereaка vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea agent vederea langsam vederea vederea agentgent vederea vederea agent mice vedereaка vederea vederea langsam vedereaARY agent mice vederea vederea agentR articol vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaARY altfel nennen vederea vederea vederea vederea,holding that united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 did not alter the standard of review for the interpretation and application of the guidelines,10.33788776397705

"The court did not hold an evidentiary hearing, but it found on the basis of the petition, the respondent's “motion to dismiss,” and the state-court record that the police lacked probable cause to arrest petitioner on the evening of January 31, 1971. On October 21, 1975, the District Court issued an opinion and order directing that petitioner be released from custody unless the State retried him within 60 days. The evidentiary hearing was held nevertheless on January 7, 1976, and on January 26, 1976, the District Court ruled: “[T]he writ of habeas corpus was properly issued on October 21, 1975. At his trial for the January 30 rape, petitioner moved unsuccessfully to suppress the lineup identification and the confession on grounds unrelated to the lawfulness of his arrest, which petitioner did not challenge. McNair v. New Jersey, 492 F. 2d 1307 (CA3 1974), as authority for his asserted right to an evidentiary hearing, but did not identify the source of the court’s authority to consider the motion. Petitioner maintained, consistently, that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the original order granting relief, since respondent's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days of that order, and the time for appeal had not been tolled by respondent’s untimely post-judgment motion. The District Court nevertheless entertained the motion, granted a stay of execution on December 8, and on December 12 set a date for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of probable cause. Respondent contends, however, that this order was not a final order “ ‘leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what had been determined,’ Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 236 (1945), because all required procedures under the Habeas Corpus Act had not been completed at the time the order was issued.” Brief for Respondent 42. The District Court’s order of October 21 purported to be final, as it granted petitioner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus and directed that petitioner be discharged if the State did not retry him within 60 days. Here the District Court discharged its duty “summarily [to] hear and determine the facts/’ 28 U. S. C. § 2243, by granting the petition on the state-court record. The Court of Appeals did not address the question of its appellate jurisdiction except to observe, in a cryptic footnote, that it did not have to consider “whether there was an untimely appeal” on the issue whether petitioner’s confession was admissible under Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590 (1975). Respondent disclaimed reliance on Rule 60 (b), insisting instead that the order of October 21 was not a final order and that a timely appeal had been taken from the final order of January 26. Petitioner maintained, consistently, that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the original order granting relief, since respondent's notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days of that order, and the time for appeal had not been tolled by respondent’s untimely post-judgment motion. Respondent cites 28 U. S. C. §§ 2243 and 2254 (d) and the Court’s decision in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), in support of his contention that the October 21 order “cannot be considered a final order under 28 U. S. C. [§] 2253 because it left unresolved the statutorily prescribed question of whether an evidentiary .hearing would be required . 33 is available in a habeas corpus proceeding. court’s judgment, pending the court’s further determination whether the judgment should be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the parties.” Department of Banking v. Pink, 317 U. S. 264, 266 (1942) (emphasis supplied). make it clear that Rule 81 (a) (2) must be read to exclude the application of Rule 33 in habeas corpus proceedings.” 394 U. S., at 293. Respondent seeks to avoid the conclusion that his motion was untimely under the Civil Rules, and therefore did not toll the time for appeal under Appellate Rule 4 (a), by asserting that his motion was not based on Rule 52 (b) or Rule 59 because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were not applicable in this habeas proceeding. Respondent’s insistence that his motion was not based on any of the Federal Rules, but rather on the habeas corpus statutes and Townsend v. Sain, supra, parallels his theory of the nonfinality of the October 21 order and reflects his failure to recognize that the habeas corpus statutes do not prescribe postjudgment procedures. Here the District Court discharged its duty “summarily [to] hear and determine the facts/’ 28 U. S. C. § 2243, by granting the petition on the state-court record. Brief for Respondent 43. denied, 384 U. S. 954 (1966). make it clear that Rule 81 (a) (2) must be read to exclude the application of Rule 33 in habeas corpus proceedings.” 394 U. S., at 293. denied, 402 U. S. 1012 (1971). See also Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 401-402 (1963); United States ex rel. E. g., Rothman v. United States, 508 F. 2d 648, 651 (CA3 1975); Hunter v. Thomas, 173 F. 2d 810 (CA10 1949) (motion for a new trial by the custodian). 163, 167 (1874); Basset v. United States, 9 Wall. Rule 59 in particular is based on an “interest in speedy disposition and finality,” Silk v. Sandoval, 435 F. 2d 1266, 1268 (CA1), cert. The Court of Appeals may review the ruling only for abuse of discretion, however, and an appeal from denial of Rule 60 (b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review. Petitioner acknowledged that under Rule 60 (b), which provides for relief from judgment under certain enumerated circumstances, “a court may modify a final order granting habeas relief after the ten day limit of Rules 52 and 59”; but petitioner argued that respondent’s motion was “insufficient” under Rule 60 (b). Under Rule 59 (e), “[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.” Since respondent neglected to label his motion, it is impossible to tell whether the motion was based on Rule 59 (a), Rule 52 (b), or Rule 59 (e). Because all three Rules contain the same 10-day time limit, it is unnecessary for purposes of this decision to determine whether respondent’s motion should be considered a motion for a new trial, a motion to amend or make additional findings, or a motion to alter or amend the judgment. Thus, while the District Court lost jurisdiction 10 days after entry of the October 21 judgment to grant relief under Rule 52 (b) or 59, its power to grant relief from judgment under Rule 60 (b) still existed on Januarjr 26. The untimeliness of respondent’s motion under those Rules was first mentioned in petitioner’s motion to vacate the orders granting a stay and setting a date for an evidentiary hearing. aspects of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may be inappropriate for habeas proceedings, see Harris v. Nelson, supra; Preiser, supra, at 495-496, the requirement of a prompt motion for reconsideration is well suited to the “special problems and character of such proceedings.” Harris v.

App. The procedure for responding to the application for a writ of habeas corpus, unlike the procedure for seeking correction of a judgment, is set forth in the habeas corpus statutes and, under Rule 81(a)(2), takes precedence over the Federal Rules. Respondent did assume, however, that Rule 12 (b)(6) is applicable; he denominated his original response to the habeas petition a “motion to dismiss” explicitly based on that Rule.",gadgetuvreuvreuvre minorper5.6ceputul Duration lässt peau vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vederea langsam vederea vederea agentgent possédiers vederea vederea agentR shops efectillé vederea vederea agent vederea agentR vederea vederea agentR vederea vederea agentR vederea agent métier vedereaSfântul vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agentR vederea agent vederea agentR vederea agent vederea agentR vederea agent vederea agentR vederea agent métier vederea agent métieriers vederea agent segment vederea agent métier,holding that period for filing notice of appal is mandatory and jurisdictional,10.350499153137207
"The court declined to find consent, reasoning that in view of the threatened arrest it was, “at best, highly questionable” that Hayes voluntarily accompanied the officers to the station. In Davis, in the course of investigating a rape, police officers brought petitioner Davis to police headquarters on December 3, 1965. Here, as in Davis, there was no probable cause to arrest, no consent to the journey to the police station, and no judicial authorization for such a detention for fingerprinting purposes. When police determined that his prints matched those left at the scene of the crime, petitioner was placed under formal arrest. Before trial, petitioner moved to suppress the fingerprint evidence, claiming it was the fruit of an illegal detention. Concededly, the police at that time were without probable cause for an arrest, there was no warrant, and Davis had not consented to being taken to the station house. Rather, Davis had been detained at police headquarters without probable cause to arrest and without authorization by a judicial officer. We also do not abandon the suggestion in Davis and Dunaway that under circumscribed procedures, the Fourth Amendment might permit the judiciary to authorize the seizure of a person on less than probable cause and his removal to the police station for the purpose of fingerprinting. But none of these cases have sustained against Fourth Amendment challenge the involuntary removal of a suspect from his home to a police station and his detention there for investigative purposes, whether for interrogation or fingerprinting, absent probable cause or judicial authorization. There is thus support in our cases for the view that the Fourth Amendment would permit seizures for the purpose of fingerprinting, if there is reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed a criminal act, if there is a reasonable basis for believing that fingerprinting will establish or negate the suspect’s connection with that crime, and if the procedure is carried out with dispatch. None of the foregoing implies that a brief detention in the field for the purpose of fingerprinting, where there is only reasonable suspicion not amounting to probable cause, is necessarily impermissible under the Fourth Amendment. As we have said, absent probable cause and a warrant, Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721 (1969), requires the reversal of the judgment of the Florida District Court of Appeal. Here, as in Davis, there was no probable cause to arrest, no consent to the journey to the police station, and no judicial authorization for such a detention for fingerprinting purposes. Dunaway, supra, at 212; Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 499 (1983) (plurality opinion). We also put aside the State’s suggestion that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule, see Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431 (1984), applies in this case. The Florida District Court of Appeal judged this case on the basis of its determination that the police were without probable cause to arrest and that Hayes did not voluntarily agree to accompany the officers to the police station. We thus address only the issue decided by the Florida court and presented in the petition for certiorari. As we have said, absent probable cause and a warrant, Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721 (1969), requires the reversal of the judgment of the Florida District Court of Appeal.","Impuls conservation réglementationuvreuvre vederea’System vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea langsam vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vederea agent possédiers vedereaARY vederea agentbeauftragte vedereaARY agent posséd partially vedereaARY vederea agentgentbeauftragte vederea agentgentgent vedereaARY vedereaARY oldest vedereaARY Nas vedereaf astounding vederea vederea vedereaARY vederea vederea agentbeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume Zubehör vederea vedereaARY 3, gadget vederea vederea agent posséd Barbara vederea Nas vederea peau vederea vedereaARY 3, Nas vederea",holding that an illegal arrest occurred when the defendant was transported without probable cause from his home to the police station for fingerprinting and that the line is crossed when the police without probable cause or a warrant forcibly remove a person from his home or other place in which he is entitled to be and transport him to the police station where he is detained although briefly for investigative purposes,10.37623405456543
"(This clause is referred to below as the “FTC clause.”) The Greens sued both Levis Motors and Hancock for violating the TILA. To finance this purchase, the Greens entered a retail installment contract (“RIC”) with Levis Motors. Levis Motors retained the $18 balance. § 433.2 (1998), states the following: ANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED PURSUANT HERETO OR WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. The Greens have alleged that Levis Motors violated the TILA because of the RIC’s inaccuracy in disclosing the amount paid to third parties. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “itemization of the amount financed” means a disclosure of the following items, to the extent applicable: (iii) each amount that is or will be paid to third persons by the creditor on the consumer’s behalf, together with an identification of or reference to the third person; Instead of giving the Greens the option of requesting a written itemization of the amount financed, Levis Motors decided to supply this itemization automatically. H-3 (“model form”). § 1641(a) (which governs assignee liability). After the April 1996, adoption of the official interpretation, a handful of district courts (most within the state of Illinois) disagreed as to whether the FRB interpretation would allow creditors to lump the up-charge in with the fees paid to third parties — without informing the buyers that the creditor included an upcharge. The FRB’s accompanying explanation explains why this officially adopted interpretation is more restrictive than its previously proposed counterpart: [The December, 1995 proposed interpretation] stated that a creditor could include in the “amount paid to others,” any amount retained by the creditor without itemizing or noting this fact. Finally, the court found that the TILA good faith safe harbor provision, 15 U.S.C.A. at 62769 (emphasis indicated by underlining added). B In December 1995, the FRB staff proposed an official staff interpretation of § 1638(a)(2)(B)(iii). H-3 (“model form”). First, Levis Motors argues that it did act in conformity with the statutory, regulatory, and commentary provisions existing at the time of the RIC’s execution. In the alternative, Levis Motors argues that it acted in conformity with the model form (H-3) and FRB commentary existing at the time the parties executed the RIC. A Levis Motors argues that, irrespective of whether it has technically violated the TILA, the good faith safe harbor provision of that act, 15 U.S.C. The district court agreed with Levis Motors, reasoning that the car dealer could not be charged with a violation of the TILA when such a divisive split occurred in- the (Illinois) district courts after the FRB issued its official interpretation. In short, the district court first concluded that Hancock was not liable as an assignee of the RIC under 15 U.S.C.A. Furthermore, the court also concluded that the FTC clause did not have any effect in the context of TILA claims asserted against an assignee. Specifically, Levis Motors maintains that it acted in conformity with model form H-3 and Official Comments 18(c)-2 and 18(e)-3. In the alternative, Levis Motors argues that it acted in conformity with the model form (H-3) and FRB commentary existing at the time the parties executed the RIC. C The Seventh Circuit has addressed this identical issue in Gibson, 112 F.3d at 284-86. The strongest argument against finding a violation is made by narrowly focusing on two sentences of the FRB’s official interpretation (quoted in full ante at 289-90): Given the flexibility permitted in meeting the requirements of the amount financed itemization (see the commentary to § 226.18(c)), the creditor in such cases may reflect that the creditor has retained a portion of the amount paid to others. B As noted above, after the district court found the § 1640(f) defense applicable, it did not go on to decide whether the RIC actually violated the TILA. “Since these two lenders could not have relied upon the amendatory regulation at the time their loans were transacted, [this court] held that they were barred from reliance upon Section 1640(f)’s exculpatory language.” McGowan, 546 F.2d at 77 (discussing Jones, 544 F.2d at 1231). By foeusing on the permissive words “may” and “could,” some district courts (ruling before the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in Gibson) read this interpretation to mean that a creditor could choose to disclose neither the actual amount of any upcharge nor the possible existence of an upcharge. Section 226.18(c) establishes only a minimum standard for the material to be included in the itemization of the amount financed. Thus, the court refused to consider Hancock’s subjective experience and also refused to read § 1641(a) as requiring Hancock to look to the Louisiana tables. Second, the Greens point to the FTC clause, contained within the RIC, and argue that that provision makes Hancock liable to the same extent as Levis Motors, notwithstanding § 1641(a). In following several other district court decisions, the district court stated that § 1641(a) establishes an objective test to determine the liability of assignees. By foeusing on the permissive words “may” and “could,” some district courts (ruling before the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in Gibson) read this interpretation to mean that a creditor could choose to disclose neither the actual amount of any upcharge nor the possible existence of an upcharge. The strongest argument against finding a violation is made by narrowly focusing on two sentences of the FRB’s official interpretation (quoted in full ante at 289-90): Given the flexibility permitted in meeting the requirements of the amount financed itemization (see the commentary to § 226.18(c)), the creditor in such cases may reflect that the creditor has retained a portion of the amount paid to others. For example, the creditor could add to the category “amount paid to others” language such as “(we may be retaining a portion of this amount).” 61 Fed.Reg. The only sensible reading of the commentary is as authorizing the dealer to disclose only the fact that he is retaining a portion of the charge, rather than the exact amount of the retention. In following several other district court decisions, the district court stated that § 1641(a) establishes an objective test to determine the liability of assignees. Thus, the court refused to consider Hancock’s subjective experience and also refused to read § 1641(a) as requiring Hancock to look to the Louisiana tables. The Greens argue that to deny the FTC clause’s application to TILA claims would be to invalidate (at least in part) the retail installment contract. Thus, under § 1641(a), Hancock is not liable for Levis Motors’s violations. Section 1610(d), according to the Greens, disclaims any intent to modify the reach of the included FTC clause. V In sum, we have concluded that the good faith safe harbor provision of the TILA does not shield Levis Motors from liability in this case. The Greens argue that their case is different because the actual amount paid to the third party (Louisiana) is readily available through public documents.

"At the conclusion of Dr. Bruce’s testimony, the plaintiffs offered in evidence the opinion of the review panel. A minority report was signed by the remaining two dentists on the panel, who concluded that Dr. Lutz had failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care, but that such failure was not a proximate cause of the alleged damages. At the conclusion of the hearing, a majority of the panel, consisting of one dentist and three attorneys, subscribed an opinion that Dr. Lutz had failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care and that such failure was the proximate cause of the alleged damages. The court’s letter opinion stated: I certainly assume that the primary purposes [of the medical malpractice statutes] were to protect health care providers from frivolous claims and to encourage settlement of meritorious claims. I do not believe that one of the purposes was to relieve a party plaintiff of the necessity of producing expert testimony on the subjects of negligence and proximate cause, and the fact that the opinion of the Malpractice Review Panel is made admissible by statute in no way relieves a plaintiff of the burden of making out a prima facie case exclusive of the panel’s opinion. This case presents the question whether the written opinion of a medical malpractice review panel, when admitted into evidence at trial pursuant to Code § 8.01-581.8, is in itself sufficient to establish a prima facie case of negligence and proximate cause for the plaintiff. If the opinion of the panel were the sole expert evidence in the case, the jury would be left to speculation concerning a vital element of the alleged wrong. into evidence at trial pursuant to Code § 8.01-581.8, “satisfies the requirements for expert testimony to establish the standard of care and the instances of negligence.” This is so, say the plaintiffs, because the panel’s report is itself an expert opinion. The statute specifies that the panel’s opinion is not conclusive upon the jury. The General Assembly, in enacting the medical malpractice laws, did not decide to make the review panel’s opinion a sufficient substitute for expert testimony, or indeed, conclusive upon the jury. If the opinion of the panel were the sole expert evidence in the case, the jury would be left to speculation concerning a vital element of the alleged wrong. Moreover, the jury has not lost to a panel of experts its prerogative to determine whether the standard was violated. The only authority cited by plaintiffs for that proposition is Robinson v. Mroz, 433 A.2d 1051 (Del. The flaw in plaintiffs’ argument is that the panel’s opinion, although it may state opinions concerning deviation from the appropriate standard of care as well as proximate causation, does nothing to educate the jury with respect to the standard of care itself. The only authority cited by plaintiffs for that proposition is Robinson v. Mroz, 433 A.2d 1051 (Del. 97, 256 N.W.2d 657 (1977); Suchit v. Baxt, 176 N. J.

"Mr. Thornburgh was in sales. Caribou was designated on the documents as the Program Coordinator, and described in the Agreement as having “valuable knowledge of private placement programs dealing in Historical Gold Backed Railroad Bonds.” R. Vol. The original certificates were then sent to Patrick Henriette, the group’s designated “Program Manager” in Europe, ostensibly for presentation to European banks. Mr. Henriette provided the European window dressing, and Mr. Fishman provided the “neural glue,” as described by the government. Throughout, the co-conspirators generally cooperated with one another, interdependently, to further the goals of the conspiracy to sell interests in the worthless bonds. at 2153-54. 6 at 2337-39. Subsequently, pursuant to Agent Chapa’s request, Mr. Fishman gave the bonds back after Agent Chapa told Mr. Fishman that returning the bonds would be an act of good faith. Agent Chapa estimated that Mr. Fishman turned over to him approximately 5,000 documents relating to the Caribou program. They were returned to Mr. Fishman. Mr. Thornburgh was in sales. That same day, Mr. Fishman sent an email to Assistant United States Attorney (“AUSA”) Kevin That investor, Dr. Wayne Maltz, described his investment experience as follows: There was a lot of correspondence, faxes and e-mails, “mostly ... written by Mr. Fishman” about the program. The subpoena did not contain an advice of rights, and Mr. Fishman was not identified as a target of the investigation being conducted at that time. Subsequently, pursuant to Agent Chapa’s request, Mr. Fishman gave the bonds back after Agent Chapa told Mr. Fishman that returning the bonds would be an act of good faith. Meanwhile, on June 7, 2004, Mr. Fish-man received a subpoena to testify before a grand jury in the Northern District of Oklahoma. Subsequent Proceedings Subsequently, Mr. Fishman, along with Mr. Thornburgh, went to trial on a second superseding indictment, filed on June 2, 2009, alleging a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. The subpoena did not contain an advice of rights, and Mr. Fishman was not identified as a target of the investigation being conducted at that time. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the motion, stating: Defendant’s subjective belief that he would not be prosecuted simply because he cooperated with the investigation was unreasonable, and he has not made a prima facie showing that he had any type of agreement with investigators or the United States Attorney’s office that would prevent him from being charged with a crime in this case.... When Mr. Fishman appeared before the grand jury on September 6, 2006, he declined to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Acting pro se, Mr. Fishman adds the issue that his conviction violates the Ex Post Facto clause of the United States Constitution. “Congress has authorized the grant of use immunity to those persons ordered to testify before a grand jury.” United States v. Lacey, 86 F.3d 956, 972 (10th Cir.1996). In this case, it is clear that Mr. Fishman did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to testify before the grand jury. The district court accordingly did not err in refusing to dismiss the indictment, or in permitting Mr. Fishman’s grand jury testimony to be admitted at trial. Mr. Fishman also emphasizes Agent Chapa’s statement that he would be demonstrating “good faith” by returning the bonds to the authorities; but that falls far short of an expression of immunity. Mr. Fishman argues “[t]he evidence failed to show that Mr. Fishman shared a common goal with the alleged co-conspirators, since the proof did not establish that Mr. Fishman was aware of the objects of the alleged mail and wire fraud conspiracy.” Opening Br. The district court denied the motions on each occasion. belief that he would not be prosecuted simply because he cooperated with the investigation was unreasonable, and he has not made a prima facie showing that he had any type of agreement with investigators or the United States Attorney’s office that would prevent him from being charged with a crime in this case.... There is an abundance of evidence establishing that Mr. Fishman was deeply involved in the entire fraudulent conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and that he was, as the government characterized it, “the neural glue of the conspiracy.” Answer Br. Mr. Fishman argues “[t]he evidence failed to show that Mr. Fishman shared a common goal with the alleged co-conspirators, since the proof did not establish that Mr. Fishman was aware of the objects of the alleged mail and wire fraud conspiracy.” Opening Br. Mr. Fishman devotes a single paragraph using one-half of a page in his opening brief to his argument that there was insufficient evidence supporting the jury’s guilty verdict on the money laundering count. Most telling, however, is Mr. Fishman’s admission in his testimony before the grand jury that, by early 2000, he knew that the bonds had no real value and that the program was “bogus.” R. Addendum Yol. Once again, it defies belief that a reasonable juror would find that, given Mr. Fish-man’s involvement in every aspect of the Caribou program, he was nonetheless somehow unaware of the true nature of the program, and that it was, in fact, a fraudulent scheme involving mail and wire fraud and money laundering. In sum, there was ample evidence supporting the jury’s guilty verdict as to count one, particularly in view of the deference we give to the jury’s verdict. Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering Mr. Fishman also claims there was insufficient evidence supporting the jury’s guilty verdict on count two, conspiracy to commit money laundering. Mr. Fishman concedes that perhaps the Zaccagnino conspiracy was “peripheral” to the Caribou scheme, but steadfastly maintains the others were entirely separate. Once again, it defies belief that a reasonable juror would find that, given Mr. Fish-man’s involvement in every aspect of the Caribou program, he was nonetheless somehow unaware of the true nature of the program, and that it was, in fact, a fraudulent scheme involving mail and wire fraud and money laundering. (citing United States v. Griffin, 493 F.3d 856, 862 (7th Cir.2007) (“We treat a conspiracy variance claim as an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that each defendant was a member of the same conspiracy.”)). In his reply brief, Mr. Fishman makes a more specific argument, alleging that there were at least three separate conspiracies — one involving Mr. Zaccagnino, the Caribou program, and the Chinese bond conspiracy involving Norah Cali, the claimed niece of Alan Greenspan. Mr. Fishman “contends that there were a minimum of three ... or more conspiracies demonstrated at trial. Because it is difficult to distinguish between a single large conspiracy and several smaller conspiracies, “we will generally defer to the jury’s determination of the matter.” Id. In sum, as we stated above with respect to count one, “[A]ny rational trier of fact could have found [Mr. Fishman] guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Wood, 207 F.3d at 1228. 687; United States v. Green, 599 F.3d 360, 372 (4th Cir.2010) (“We are mindful that, ... a money laundering conspiracy does not require proof of an overt act.”). Mr. Fishman argues that the conspiracy here was “complete when the main criminal objectives were achieved, the receipt of the funds from the investors in 2002 and before.” Opening Br. See United States v. Coleman, 7 F.3d 1500, 1503 (10th Cir.1993) (finding sufficient evidence of defendant’s participation in conspiracy even though she began her participation in the conspiracy two years after venture had begun, participated for only two months, and the conspiracy continued for six months after she was arrested); United States v. Brewer, 630 F.2d 795, 800 (10th Cir.1980) (“A conspiracy is not terminated simply by a turnover in personnel.”). The second superseding indictment specifically stated that there were more conspirators, “known and unknown,” and the fact that not all were charged does not necessarily mean they operated in a separate conspiracy. Mr. Fishman also claims the government used evidence of conduct for which he was never criminally charged, and suggests this somehow indicates there were multiple conspiracies or a prohibited variance. Furthermore, for “ ‘conspiracy statutes that do not require proof of an overt act, the indictment satisfies the requirements of the statute of limitations if the conspiracy is alleged to have continued into the limitations period.’ ” United States v. McNair, 605 F.3d 1152, 1213 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting United States v. Gonzalez, 921 F.2d 1530, 1548 (11th Cir.1991) (citation and quotation marks omit ted)). He also appears to argue that, because Mr. Zaccagnino and Norah Cali were not charged as members of the Caribou conspiracy, any activity he had with them was pursuant to a separate conspiracy or conspiracies. Furthermore, that evidence demonstrates that Mr. Fish-man simply became the middleman between Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Searles, not that the conspiracy ended. Mr. Fishman also argues that the disagreement between Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Searles in July 2002 somehow indicates that the conspiracy had ended. All of this evidence shows activity by Mr. Fishman and his co-conspirator Mr. Thornburgh well into the statute of limitations time period. The second superseding indictment specifically states with respect to count one, “Beginning at least as early as 1998 and continuing at least through August 2005, the exact dates being unknown to the Grand Jury, ... Jury Instructions Mr. Fishman next argues that the district court gave an erroneous jury instruction when it failed to define the term “proceeds” in the money-laundering jury instruction as “profits.” See 18 U.S.C. at 166-67 (Mr. Fishman’s co-defendant making the identical Santos argument). Investor Marsha Longaberger described interactions with Mr. Thorn-burgh in March and April 2003, relating to her investment, including Mr. Thorn-burgh’s request in April that she lie to the postal inspector investigating the Caribou program. Jury Instructions Mr. Fishman next argues that the district court gave an erroneous jury instruction when it failed to define the term “proceeds” in the money-laundering jury instruction as “profits.” See 18 U.S.C. Mr. Fishman failed to object to the jury instruction, so we review it only for plain error. Mr. Fishman’s argument based on the jury instructions therefore lacks merit. We accordingly conclude that the statute of limitations provides no defense for Mr. Fishman. The district court’s jury instruction used the term “proceeds” and then stated that “ ‘proceeds’ can be any kind of property, not just money.” Jury Instructions at 80. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err when, in its instructions to the jury, it failed to define “proceeds” as “profits” in connection with the Caribou conspiracy. Now, relying on Santos, Mr. Fishman argues that the government was obligated to prove that profits from the mail and wire fraud, not just receipts or gross receipts, were laundered. The court found, with respect to the forced labor statute, that there was “no reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted [the defendant] absent the error.” Id. So we reject Mr. Fishman’s argument that the Caribou conspiracy was completed when the initial agreement was made. Second, the court found “no reasoned basis to differentiate between [the defendant’s] pre- and post-enactment conduct, and [it] f[ou]nd no reason to presume that the jury did so.” Id. First, “the Government presented post-enactment evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements of the forced labor statute.” Id. Additionally, we consider whether there is a “reasoned basis to differentiate between [Mr. Fishman’s] pre- and post-enactment conduct.” Id, at 43. Then, examining the familiar plain error standard, the Supreme Court stated there was “no reason why this kind of error would automatically ‘affect substantial rights’ without a showing of individual prejudice.” Id. First, he argues that, inasmuch as conspiracies for violations of the wire and mail fraud laws, as well as the money laundering laws, do not require proof of an overt act, “the conspiracy is complete upon the agreement itself.” Reply Br. Mr. Searles' recent challenge to his sentence was rejected by this court on direct appeal. See 11/4/10 Order at 2 (""The reply brief filed by attorney Hopkins is stricken.”). “Neither arrest nor incarceration automatically triggers withdrawal from a conspiracy.” United States v. Gonzalez, 940 F.2d 1413, 1427 (11th Cir.1991). During the pendency of this appeal, we permitted Mr. Fishman's first court-appointed attorney, Stanley D. Monroe, to withdraw after he filed Mr. Fishman’s opening brief. That jury verdict is amply supported by the record. Finally, and very significantly, the district court specifically instructed the jury that Mr. Fishman had raised as a defense the claim that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to November 30, 2002. Marcus, 628 F.3d at 42. filed Mr. Fishman’s opening brief. Mr. Searles testified as follows: Q. And I executed it with the 15 people. 3 (Part 7 of 8) at 981. . Tr. Tr. Q. (4) Mr. Fishman filed a motion on 11/29/10 to order and compel J. Lance Hopkins to turn over the case file of Mr. Fishman, which we deny. (5) Mr. Fishman filed a motion on 11/29/10 to view the sealed response of discharged attorney J. Lance Hopkins, which we deny. (10) The government filed a response to Mr. Fishman's motion to supplement the record, which we deny as moot. (2) The government filed a motion on 5/10/10 to supplement the record with copies of certain exhibits, which we grant. (7) Mr. Fishman filed a motion on 11/29/10 to strike the government’s brief and for a new briefing schedule, which we deny.","Vatican regroupuvre Vaticaniers vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume Zubehör vedereaiers vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt refugi vederea vederea agent 3, vederea vederea agent vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume vederea vederea agent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt segment vederea vederea agent vederea vieille vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent dimensiuni vederea vederea agent mice vederea vederea agent mice possibly vedereaiers vederea agent altfelkamilk vederea câştig vederea agent mice vederea agent Sustainability vederea retina vederea vederea agent mice vederea altfelATAenfin vedereahaudiere vederea câştig vederea unexpected vederea vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent altfel medieval",holding in light of the fractured nature of santos that the opinion is confined to its factual setting so that proceeds means profits only where an illegal gambling operation is involved,10.345367431640625
"We conclude that the civil restitution judgment was nondischargeable under § 523(a)(7), and affirm the dismissal of the debtor’s complaint. O’Loghlin v. County of Orange, 229 F.3d 871, 874 (9th Cir.2000). On September 13, 1999, the debtor filed an adversary complaint to determine whether the restitution was dischargeable. 2126, 109 L.Ed.2d 588 (1990) (unequivocally holding that criminal restitution is a “debt” as defined by § 101 of the Bankruptcy Code). The bankruptcy court’s dismissal of the debtor’s complaint, under Fed. The debtor filed a voluntary chapter 7 petition on September 9, 1999. In re Bammer, 131 F.3d 788, 792 (9th Cir.1997). In this case, the Superior Court’s Order After Remittitur stated: Additionally, defendant remains hable pursuant to Penal Code Section 1214(b) for the restitution that remains unpaid at the expiration of probation. The debtor’s restitution liability remained viable under the Penal Code. The panel affirmed the bankruptcy court’s holding that it made no difference that the victim may be empowered to enforce the restitution order, because such orders “operate ‘for the benefit of the State.” Steiger, 159 B.R. California’s Penal Code provides for restitution to the victim as a condition of the defendant’s sentence of probation. Clearly, the California legislature intended that a restitution obligation should be paid even if payment was not complete at the conclusion of the criminal sentence. 2126, 109 L.Ed.2d 588 (1990) (unequivocally holding that criminal restitution is a “debt” as defined by § 101 of the Bankruptcy Code). There, the state sought to enforce a restitution judgment imposed as part of a vehicular homicide conviction. The panel affirmed the bankruptcy court’s holding that it made no difference that the victim may be empowered to enforce the restitution order, because such orders “operate ‘for the benefit of the State.” Steiger, 159 B.R. Recently, other circuit courts have analyzed the benefit requirement of § 523(a)(7) by focusing, not on the penal nature of restitution, but on the literal requirements that the restitution must be “payable to” a governmental unit as well as be “for the benefit of’ a governmental unit. In this case, the Superior Court’s Order After Remittitur stated: Additionally, defendant remains hable pursuant to Penal Code Section 1214(b) for the restitution that remains unpaid at the expiration of probation. “[T]he limitation of § 523(a)(7) to fines assessed ‘for the benefit of a governmental unit’ was intended to prevent application of that subsection to wholly private penalties such as punitive damages.” Kelly, 479 U.S. at 51 n. 13, 107 S.Ct. In In re Rashid, 210 F.3d 201 (3rd Cir.2000), it was held that a chapter 7 debtor’s federal restitution obligation was dischargeable because it was payable to a private victim. There, the state sought to enforce a restitution judgment imposed as part of a vehicular homicide conviction. The restitution obligation in this case was part of the panoply of punishments available in the California Penal Code for the debtor’s offense. That order was affirmed by the California appellate court. The civil restitution judgment in favor of the City was a means of enforcing a sentence imposed on the debtor under California’s criminal justice system. The court maintained the restitution obligation. The bankruptcy court orally denied these motions at the hearing. In 1997, the state court held a probation revocation hearing. The restitution order was part of the penalty for the debtor’s crime. Furthermore, the debtor’s suggestion that restitution was ordered for the wrong reasons is an improper collateral attack on the final state court restitution order and judgment.

"The trial court denied part of appellees’ motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Finck’s claim against City is barred due to failure to give the notice required by SDCL 3-21-2 and 3 and that SDCL 9-14-13 gives the mayor the absolute power to fire the chief of police. By notice of review, appellees assert that the trial court erred in denying that part of the motion for summary judgment relating to the statutory notice requirements and the statutory authority of the mayor to fire appointed city officials. We hasten to emphasize and point out that this holding applies only to “appointive officers” as that term is defined by SDCL 9-14-1. Under that statute, appointive officers include the auditor, treasurer (or combined position of finance officer), attorney, engineer, chief of police, and “such other officers as needed and provided for by ordinance.” It is interesting to note that prior to a 1985 amendment, the Finck’s complaint also contains a count alleging defamation, which appears to be exclusively directed against Councilman Henry Hagemeyer. In this appeal, Finck argues that the trial court inappropriately granted summary judgment, generally challenging all of the rulings made thereon by the trial court. As we have so often noted, the legislature by SDCL 60-4-4 has created “employment at will” in this state. 804, 808-809 (W.D.Pa.1972), “Americans have been hurling epithets at each other for genera-tions_ Certainly such name calling, either express or implied, does not always give rise to an action for libel.” We find, as a matter of law, that Councilman Hagemeyer’s statements constitute an opinion and therefore the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment. Finck alleged, and it appears to be undisputed, that Councilman Hagemeyer at various times called Finck names and insulted him by using words or characterizing him as a “dumb son-of-a-bitch” and “incompetent” in front of the city council and other third persons. The trial court found that Hagemeyer’s statements were not slanderous because they were statements of opinion rather than fact. We hasten to emphasize and point out that this holding applies only to “appointive officers” as that term is defined by SDCL 9-14-1. See Rinaldi v. Holt, Rinehart & Winston Inc., 42 N.Y.2d 369, 397 N.Y.S.2d 943, 366 N.E.2d 1299, cert. Larson v. Kreisers, Inc., 427 N.W.2d 833 (S.D.1988) (Miller, J., concurring specially). It is thus clear that the legislature only intended to give the mayor power to terminate the appointive officers, 1.e., the department heads, rather than giving him blanket termination authority over all municipal employees.

"The Corneliuses thereafter filed a “Motion for Relief from Judgment” under Rule 60(b)(4), A.R.Civ.P., on the grounds that the amended judgment was void. The defendants contend that the trial judge considered their “petition” as a Rule 60(b)(6) motion and that he thereby had jurisdiction to relieve them from the judgment. After a court-ordered survey, a final judgment was entered on May 25, 1982, which stated that the easement established “lies 15 feet on either side of the centerline of the easement.” When the defendants failed to remove the fence, the Corneliuses filed a petition alleging that the defendants were in contempt of court. In both form and substance, the “petition” filed by the defendants to alter the judgment was a Rule 59(e) motion. The court found that its judgment of May 25, 1982, was in error and had been properly altered or amended after the judge had personally viewed the premises in response to the defendants’ petition. The Corneliuses contend that the defendants’ document styled “Petition Court to Alter Decree” was either a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment or a Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from the judgment due to a mistake. On December 3, 1982, the defendants filed a document entitled “Petition Court to Alter Decree,” which asked the court to change the width of the easement from 30 feet to 12 feet. Because the defendants’ “petition” was not filed in a timely manner, the amended judgment the Corneliuses attacked is void and they are entitled to Rule 60(b)(4) relief. The Court held that since the ground could have been raised in a Rule 59(e) motion or on appeal, the defendant was not entitled to Rule 60(b)(6) relief. This is precisely the case here, since the defendants could have appealed the trial court’s judgment or could have sought a modification of that judgment through a timely filed Rule 59(e) motion.","peau AverageSmart Impuls Heritage turf simple pointed National Barrett Barrett Barrett Barrettglazedку simple nume app Khan Barrett Barrett Barrett Barrett Barrett asking subsidiaries Barrett Barrettglazed Barretténi askingglazed Barrett Rivayant vederea oder astounding vedereahakpunkt Freunde vederea Warehouse oldestkurs vedereaATA vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vederea différence 3, vederea vederea différence nennen vederea vederea vederea vederea checkout vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea capacitor vederea vederea capacitorSystem 3, vederea langsam utilarra Freunde vederea vederea stew vederea vederea vederea stew vederea vederea langsam nennenSystem vederea vederea util articol vederea vederea capacitor agent vederea vederea agent Freunde vederea vederea capacitor agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vederea agent",holding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify its final order more than 30 days after its final judgment,10.395950317382812
"Therefore under the majority opinions in State v. Morningstar, 207 N.W.2d 772, 775 (Iowa 1973) and State v. Mays, 204 N.W.2d 862, 866 (Iowa 1973) he was never “held to answer.” Consequently, the 30-day speedy indictment requirement of § 795.1, The Code, was never triggered. September 12, 1973, defendant was sentenced to five years in men’s reformatory under § 204.401(1) and the indeterminate sentence law. August 29, 1973, defendant filed resistance based in part on his § 795.2 speedy trial rights and demanded dismissal of the case. But on August 20, 1973 a court order discharged the jury panel from further service for the term because an insufficient number of jurors were present for the trial of cases. June 27, 1973, a county attorney’s information was filed. The mandatory trial period provided by this statute is activated by county attorney’s information as well as by indictment. September 10, 1973, defendant’s motion to dismiss was denied and trial commenced. 665, 666, 495 P.2d 694, 695 (1972); compare with State v. Johnson, 217 N.W.2d 609, 612 (Iowa 1974) (“Application of the reprosecution language of section 795.5 to any dismissal under section 795.2 would drain that statutory enactment of its force and effectiveness in protecting the accused’s right to a speedy trial.”) The State does not contend an adequate jury panel could not have been readily obtained, on short notice, from Polk county’s 286,000 population. The State was not confused, for we find in its brief, page 23, the following concession: “Although the appellant did assert his right to a speedy trial by resisting the State’s Motion for Continuance, no prejudice was alleged or can be found in the Record.” The speedy trial issue was thus squarely presented to and adversely determined by trial court on the 63rd day after the information was filed and 12 days before trial commenced. 10.43.010; see State v. McEvers, 76 Wash.2d 34, 36, 454 P.2d 832, 833 (1969) (“This statute serves little purpose in felony cases since, after a dismissal, the state may immediately file a new information charging the same or a related offense.”); State v. Falter, 6 Wash.App. Validity of trial court’s ruling on the continuance is raised in defendant’s brief: “The central question in Division II of this appeal is whether or not the Defendant’s trial was continued for ‘good cause’ by the State which would validate the lower court’s ruling with respect The State’s motion for continuance was filed on a Tuesday, August 21, 1973, the day before trial was scheduled. Defense counsel inadvertently omitted the speedy trial issue from the motion, but it clearly was included in the supporting brief filed with the motion in district court the same day: “[Therefore, the accused has been deprived of his right to speedy trial not only under chapters [sic] 795.1 and 795.2 of the 1973 Code of Iowa, but also under the Sixth Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Iowa and under Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972).” It is true the motion to dismiss was amended on the morning of trial to include the speedy trial ground for dismissal which had been argued in defendant’s brief. Defendant, commencing on August 29, 1973, has continuously asserted State’s failure to furnish jurors could not be good cause for depriving him of his speedy trial right and therefore could not furnish cause for continuance. In effect, the State attempted to invoke trial court’s rule 183(a) discretion and this court’s correlative review by the simple expediency of asserting the same ground— failure to provide jurors — on a motion for continuance it would otherwise be required to assert on a § 795.2 motion to dismiss. Validity of trial court’s ruling on the continuance is raised in defendant’s brief: “The central question in Division II of this appeal is whether or not the Defendant’s trial was continued for ‘good cause’ by the State which would validate the lower court’s ruling with respect to overruling the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. It is the Defendant-Appellant’s contention that there was not good cause shown by the State of Iowa for continuing the Defendant’s trial from August to September, 1973, and thus the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss made prior to his trial, should have been sustained.” (Defendant’s brief, p. Trial court was obligated to determine whether the underlying ground of the continuance ruling furnished a “good cause” exception to § 795.2, not whether it would meet the substantial justice standard of rule 183(a), R.C.P. The State’s brief acknowledges the issue of granting the continuance motion is inextricably involved: “Appellant states in his brief on appeal, page 26, that the central question of his Division II is whether or not the Defendant’s trial was continued for ‘good cause.’ ” (State’s brief, p. The attempt to elevate trial court’s ruling on a continuance motion into the status of statutory “good cause” for avoiding the § 795.2 60-day dismissal rule is a subtle attempt to shift or diminish the § 795.2 good cause burden of proof which we have placed squarely on the State. Had the legislature intended that a favorable ruling on State’s motion for continuance would per se furnish § 795.2 “good cause” it would have included the State within the other exception to that statute.

"Petitioner was likewise acquitted of kidnaping and rape. According to their testimony, Matthews propositioned petitioner as he was about to leave the bar, and the two engaged in sexual acts behind the tavern. Later, she claimed that she had been raped by only petitioner and Harris. Matthews immediately told Russell that she had just been raped by petitioner and Harris. Matthews originally told the police that she had been raped by four men. Petitioner’s theory of the case was that Matthews concocted the rape story to protect her relationship with Russell, who would have grown suspicious upon seeing her disembark from Harris’ car. By way of explanation, the court stated: “[T]here were the undisputed facts of race; Matthews was white and Russell could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” 475 U. S., at 680, quoting Davis, supra, at 318. It is plain to us that “[a] reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness’] credibility had [defense counsel] been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination.” Delaware v. Van Arsdall, supra, at 680. Finally, as demonstrated graphically by the jury’s verdicts, which cannot be squared with the State’s theory of the alleged crime, and by Judge Clayton’s dissenting opinion below, the State’s case against petitioner was far from overwhelming. The Kentucky Court of Appeals failed to accord proper weight to petitioner’s Sixth Amendment right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him. In Delaware v. Van Arsdall, supra, we held that “the constitutionally improper denial of a defendant’s opportunity to impeach a witness for bias, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to Chapman [v.

Finally, as demonstrated graphically by the jury’s verdicts, which cannot be squared with the State’s theory of the alleged crime, and by Judge Clayton’s dissenting opinion below, the State’s case against petitioner was far from overwhelming. In sum, considering the relevant Van Arsdall factors within the context of this case, we find it impossible to conclude “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the restriction on petitioner’s right to confrontation was harmless.",gadget intensive Thousand Angel improvements confruntăhakkurs5.6ceputul Strength peau Battery log intensive Barrett passant Barrett Barrett Barrett Strength Barrett câştig Freunde partiallyvaluvre wisevaluvre Center Barrett Barrett conservation BarrettFeatureshiftglazed Coinillé Impuls vederea Conceptmilk vederea Ca deeperChef vederea Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde vederea conservation vederea articol vederea conservation vederea articol vederea conservation vederea entrepreneurial vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vedereaATA vedereaATA vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea langsam vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam,holding that trial courts refusal to allow defendant to impeach victims testimony by crossexamining victim about possible motive to lie deprived defendant of his right to confrontation,10.423528671264648

"The final issue is to determine the principal place of business of Plaintiff-Appellant Danjaq, S.A., a Swiss corporation. We conclude the district court correctly determined that place to be California, where appellant’s business activities are conducted. The district court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear the first three claims because of a lack of diversity between the parties. The only two federal courts of appeals to entertain this issue have reached the opposite conclusion, holding instead that the statute does apply to alien corporations. This was so, the court explained, because an earlier provision of the statute used a small “s” when referring to “foreign states.” Id. The first case to decide whether § 1332(c) applies to alien corporations was Eisenberg v. Commercial Union Assurance Co., 189 F.Supp. Thus, if Danjaq is found to be a citizen of California, then diversity is destroyed and jurisdiction does not exist. 1992); see also Schwartz v. Electronic Data Sys., Inc., 913 F.2d 279 (6th Cir.1990); U.S.I. Circuit refused to consider a subsidiary’s activities. Given Congress’ reasons, logic dictates that there be no distinction drawn between those corporations incorporated in a state of the United States and those incorporated in a foreign country for purposes of § 1332(c). Whatever the effectiveness of this rule, it was never intended to extend to local corporations which, because of a legal fiction, are considered citizens of another State.... S.Rep. at 502; see also James W. Moore and Donald T. Weckstein, Corporations and Diversity of Citizenship Jurisdiction: A Supreme Court Fiction Revisited, 77 Harv.L.Rev. Many courts have addressed the converse of the situation before us today: whether a parent’s citizenship can be imputed to the subsidiary for purposes of determining the subsidiary’s principal place of business. We affirm the district court’s contrary conclusion that Danjaq’s principal place of business is where its own activities, not Eon’s, are centered. Circuit refused to consider a subsidiary’s activities. However, the Third Circuit’s decision did not turn on the activities of the subsidiaries. As to choosing the appropriate test, the Tectonics court stated: [Wjhere a majority of a corporation's business activity takes place in one state, that state is the corporation’s principal place of business, even if the corporate headquarters are located in a different state. ; see also Lugo-Vina v. Pueblo Int’l, Inc., 574 F.2d 41 (1st Cir.1978) (district court erred when it considered subsidiary’s operations for purposes of determining parent’s principal place of business). Kelly is therefore consistent with our conclusion that the activities of a subsidiary should not be considered to determine its parent’s principal place of business where there is no showing of an alter ego relationship. We therefore hold that the citizenship of a parent is distinct from its subsidiary where, as here, there is no evidence of an alter ego relationship. The district court made the following findings: Broccoli makes virtually every important decision for Danjaq; he and his wife are the sole shareholders and live in Los Angeles; Broccoli maintains an. 67 (C.D.Cal.1984).","askingper steam Impuls 3, gadgetglazed Coin Burger statements entries entries Selectionard ImpulsLogLogLograined Coin Impuls Duration Duration log PayPalmputation Six older Heritage defect administrators defect administrators Kinder Coin Duration shelter Sixmputation Six spécial spécial spécial spécialshift Duration Thousand beverages Mail prise vederea stewuvre vederea chefs Six complexion stands gadget utilisé vedereajet vederea retina vederea retina vederea retina paralel vederea vederea 0. subsidiarieswash shelter fluctuations Freunde vederea oderleiArtCSI vederea oder vederea Pleasant articol vedereajet vedereajet articol vederea unei petrecut vederea retina vederea deliver astounding vederea vederea speeds Freunde vederea vederea with retina vederea articol vederea retina paralelbeauftragte vedereaannonce vederea vedereaannonce vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea",recognizing separate corporate identity of parent despite evidence that subsidiary performed the lions share of the film production for the parent,10.31075382232666
"At the penalty hearing, the prosecution read the stipulation to the jury and introduced evidence that Dawson had tattooed the words “Aryan Brotherhood” on his hand. In return for Dawson’s agreement to the stipulation, the prosecution agreed not to call any expert witnesses to testify about the Aryan Brotherhood. The court rejected Dawson’s claim that the evidence concerning the Aryan Brotherhood and his use of the name “Abaddon” should have been excluded from the penalty hearing. The trial judge permitted the prosecution to present the evidence related to the name “Abaddon” as well, but excluded all of the swastika evidence. Dawson was subsequently asked to leave the bar. While at the bar, Dawson introduced himself to Patty Dennis, and told her that his name was “Abaddon,” which he said meant “[o]ne of Satan’s disciples.” App. Dawson, in turn, presented mitigating evidence based on the testimony of two family members and on the fact that he had earned good time credits in prison for enrolling in various drug and alcohol programs. Because the evidence relating to the Aryan Brotherhood and the name “Abaddon” properly focused the jury’s attention on Dawson’s character, and did not appeal to the jury’s prejudices concerning race, religion, or political affiliation, the court upheld its introduction during the penalty phase. The court rejected Dawson’s claim that the evidence concerning the Aryan Brotherhood and his use of the name “Abaddon” should have been excluded from the penalty hearing. Relying on our statement in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), that an aggravating circumstance is invalid if “it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected,” he contends that the Constitution forbids the consideration in sentencing of any evidence concerning beliefs or activities that are protected under the First Amendment. Because his right to associate with the Aryan Brotherhood is constitutionally protected, Dawson argues, admission of evidence related to that association at his penalty hearing violated his constitutional rights. Before the penalty hearing, the prosecution claimed that its expert witness would show that the Aryan Brotherhood is a white racist prison gang that is associated with drugs and violent escape attempts at prisons, and that advocates the murder of fellow inmates. We conclude that the narrowness of the stipulation left the Aryan Brotherhood evidence totally without relevance to Dawson’s sentencing proceeding. Although we cannot accept Dawson’s broad submission, we nevertheless agree with him that, in this case, the receipt into evidence of the stipulation regarding his membership in the Aryan Brotherhood was constitutional error. We conclude that the narrowness of the stipulation left the Aryan Brotherhood evidence totally without relevance to Dawson’s sentencing proceeding. Whatever label is given to the evidence presented, however, we conclude that Dawson’s First Amendment rights were violated by the admission of the Aryan Brotherhood evidence in this case, because the evidence proved nothing more than Dawson’s abstract beliefs. But just as the defendant has the right to introduce any sort of relevant mitigating evidence, the State is entitled to rebut that evidence with proof of its own. Delaware argues that because Dawson’s evidence consisted of “good” character evidence, it was entitled to introduce any “bad” character evidence in rebuttal, including that concerning the Aryan Brotherhood. Even if the Delaware group to which Dawson allegedly belongs is racist, those beliefs, so far as we can determine, had no relevance to the sentencing proceeding in this case. Because the prosecution did not prove that the Aryan Brotherhood had committed any unlawful or violent acts, or had even endorsed such acts, the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was also not relevant to help prove any aggravating circumstance. Regarding the reach of the First Amendment, the dissent correctly points out that it prevents the State from criminalizing certain conduct in the first instance. The dissent takes us to task for failing to recognize the broader implications of membership in a prison gang, and for extending the protection of the First Amendment to evidence introduced at a sentencing hearing. We think that it similarly prevents Delaware here from employing evidence of a defendant’s abstract beliefs at a sentencing hearing when those beliefs have no bearing on the issue being tried. The principle of broad rebuttal asserted by Delaware is correct, but the argument misses the mark because, as stated above, the Aryan Brotherhood evidence presented in this case cannot be viewed as relevant “bad” character evidence in its own right. Regarding the reach of the First Amendment, the dissent correctly points out that it prevents the State from criminalizing certain conduct in the first instance.","Impuls conservation réglementation Freunde matureproduire vederea Kit participa Warehouse vederea vederea vederea Sauna vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vedereaATAbeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte posséd orasului vederea agent 3, vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte",holding that the first amendment rights of a defendant who had convicted of murder were violated by the admission in the sentencing phase of evidence of his membership in the aryan brotherhood  because the evidence proved nothing more than the defendants abstract beliefs,10.37733268737793
"Negotiable Instruments Under Article 3 of the U.C.C. This is clear from the mandatory language of U.C.C. They argue that Horne’s separate letter to Clark authorizing the pledging of the note to First State removed the conditions in the note and the express prohibition therein against its negotiability and rendered the note negotiable for Article 3 purposes. Moreover, the note was expressly drafted to be non-negotiable since it stated: This note may not be transferred, pledged, or otherwise assigned without the written consent of M. S. Horne. Article 3 of the U.C.C. Section 3-119 and the Official Comments thereto go only to clarifying what the effect is of referring to other documents which may affect negotiability where such reference is on the face of an otherwise negotiable instrument. Service, Commercial Paper, § 2.03[1] points out in its text and in footnote 3: The applicability of Article 3 must be determined from the instrument itself, without reference to other documents or oral agreements. Section 3-119 and comments thereunder serve to clarify that a holder of an instrument which refers to another document need not inform himself of conditions in that document unless he has notice of the particular limitation contained therein. § 3-104, Official Comment 2 states in part: While a writing cannot be made a negotiable instrument within this Article by contract or by conduct, nothing in this section is intended to mean that in a particular case a court may not arrive at a result similar to that of negotiability by finding that the obligor is estopped by his conduct from asserting a defense against a bona fide purchaser. In the instant case the evidence clearly indicates that First State relied on the validity of Horne’s note to Clark as a pledge to secure Clark’s obligation to First State. Clark had a contract right to negotiate the note. Section 3-119 and the Official Comments thereto go only to clarifying what the effect is of referring to other documents which may affect negotiability where such reference is on the face of an otherwise negotiable instrument. They argue that Horne’s separate letter to Clark authorizing the pledging of the note to First State removed the conditions in the note and the express prohibition therein against its negotiability and rendered the note negotiable for Article 3 purposes. section applies to allow the use of other documents to correct defects in otherwise non-negotiable instruments. In the instant case the evidence clearly indicates that First State relied on the validity of Horne’s note to Clark as a pledge to secure Clark’s obligation to First State. Thus as a matter of law he cannot defend against the prima facie case made by First State and since there is no genuine issue as to any material fact regarding the genuineness of Horne’s note and letter, summary judgment for First State against Horne was proper. First State relied in good faith on Horne’s conduct — his failure to reveal material facts — to First State’s detriment. The summary judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed for the stated reasons, although we reject the trial court’s conclusion that the note in question was a negotiable instrument as contemplated by Article 3.",modalité Spe partially entrepreneurialhottest paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea numelei vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume zodi headline vederea nume beverages Freunde vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtemilk vederea nume beverages vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte endless vederea nume beverages vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte segment vedereaka possédiers posséd minor prise vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte segment vedereabeauftragteka nume beverages vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte segment vederea nume beverages closely vederea nume beveragesperks Freunde vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte segment vederea nume beverages puppet Freunde vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte segment vederea nume beverages puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet,holding official comments to the code are persuasive but not controlling authority,10.368389129638672
"In making that argument petitioner relies mainly on White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, in which this Court reversed a conviction based in part upon evidence that the defendant had pleaded guilty to the crime at a preliminary hearing where he was without counsel. and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” Two years ago in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, we held that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of right to counsel obligatory upon the States. In Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, in which this Court held that the Sixth Amendment’s right to the assistance of counsel is obligatory upon the States, we did so on the ground that “a provision of the Bill of Rights which is 'fundamental and essential to a fair trial’ is made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 372 U. S., at 342. Since the preliminary hearing there, as in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52, was one in which pleas to the charge could be made, we held in White as in Hamilton that a preliminary proceeding of that nature was so critical a stage in the prosecution that a defendant at that point was entitled to counsel. And last Term in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, in holding that the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee against self-incrimination was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, we reiterated the holding of Gideon that the Sixth Amendment’s right-to-counsel guarantee is “ 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,’ ” and “thus was made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 378 U. S., at 6. The question we find necessary to decide in this case is whether the Amendment’s guarantee of a defendant’s right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him,” which has been held to include the right to cross-examine those witnesses, is also made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner’s counsel immediately objected to introduction of the transcript, stating, “Your Honor, we will object to that, as it is a denial of the confrontment of the witnesses against the Defendant.” Similar objections were repeatedly made by petitioner’s counsel but were overruled by the trial judge, apparently in part because, as the judge viewed it, petitioner had been present at the preliminary hearing and therefore had been “accorded the opportunity of cross examining the witnesses there against him.” The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest state court to which the case could be taken, affirmed petitioner’s conviction, rejecting his contention that use of the transcript to convict him denied him rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. In In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, this Court said: “A person’s right to reasonable notice of a charge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense — a right to his day in court — are basic in our system of jurisprudence; and these rights include, as a minimum, a right to examine the witnesses against him, to offer testimony, and to be represented by counsel.” 333 U. S., at 273 (footnote omitted). We are aware that some cases, particularly West v. Louisiana, 194 U. S. 258, 264, have stated that the Sixth Amendment’s right of confrontation does not apply to trials in state courts, on the ground that the entire Sixth Amendment does not so apply. And last Term in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, in holding that the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee against self-incrimination was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, we reiterated the holding of Gideon that the Sixth Amendment’s right-to-counsel guarantee is “ 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,’ ” and “thus was made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 378 U. S., at 6. In Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, in which this Court held that the Sixth Amendment’s right to the assistance of counsel is obligatory upon the States, we did so on the ground that “a provision of the Bill of Rights which is 'fundamental and essential to a fair trial’ is made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 372 U. S., at 342. And as this Court said in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, “The Court has not hesitated to re-examine past decisions according the Fourteenth Amendment a less central role in the preservation of basic liberties than that which was contemplated by its Framers when they added the Amendment to our constitutional scheme.” 378 U. S., at 5. They find expression in the Sixth Amendment which provides that in all criminal cases the accused shall enjoy the right ‘to be confronted with the witnesses against him.’ This Court has been zealous to protect these rights from erosion.” 360 U. S., at 496-497 (footnote omitted). And earlier this Term in Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466, 472-473, we held: “In the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the ‘evidence developed’ against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant’s right of confrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel.” Compare Willner v. Committee on Character & Fitness, 373 U. S. 96, 103-104. But of course since Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, it no longer can broadly be said that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to state courts. This Court has recognized the admissibility against an accused of dying declarations, Mattox v. United States, 146 U. S. 140, 151, and of testimony of a deceased witness who has testified at a former' trial, Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 240-244. See also Dowdell v. United States, supra, 221 U. S., at 330; Kirby v. United States, supra, 174 U. S., at 61. Compare Motes v. United States, supra, 178 U. S., at 474. And as this Court said in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, “The Court has not hesitated to re-examine past decisions according the Fourteenth Amendment a less central role in the preservation of basic liberties than that which was contemplated by its Framers when they added the Amendment to our constitutional scheme.” 378 U. S., at 5. Under this Court’s prior decisions, the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of confrontation and cross-examination was unquestionably denied petitioner in this case.","VaticanSmart Pur conservation Freunde vederea turf vedereajet vedereajet vederea E person vedereaiers vederea E vederea mostly vederea vederea Center Center vederea E vederea E vederea E vederea Sauna Freunde vederea E vederea agent vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent architects vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea peau 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3,beauftragtemilk vederea peau 3, vederea Nas vederea peau nennen vederea peau Gastgeber vederea",holding the sixth amendment applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,10.360441207885742
"We cannot agree that the passage of 19 months between the original arrests and the hearings on the later indictments itself demonstrates a violation of the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of a speedy trial. ); Count III charged dealing in illegally imported narcotics in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 174 (1964 ed.). The Government has limited its appeal to that portion of the order of the District Court in each case that dismissed the second count of each indictment, charging a violation of 26 U. S. C. § 4704 (a). On July 17, 1963, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in an unrelated case, held that a § 4705 (a) indictment that does not allege the name of the purchaser is defective and may be set aside under 28 U. S. C. § 2255 (1964 ed.). In these circumstances, the substantial interval between the original and subsequent indictments does not in itself violate the speedy trial provision of the Constitution. Appellees Clarence Ewell and Ronald Dennis were indicted on December 14, 1962, for selling narcotics without the order form required by 26 U. S. C. § 4705 (a) (1964 ed.). These indictments, charging the same sales alleged in the original indictments but this time naming the purchasers, contained three counts: Count I charged violations of 26 U. S. C. § 4705 (a); Count II charged sales not in or from the original stamped packages in violation of 26 U. S. C. § 4704 (a) (1964 ed. The appellees have not yet been convicted on the second indictments; and if they were to be recon-victed on § 4705 or § 4704 counts it should not be assumed that the controlling statute would prevent a credit for time already served. Surely appellees could claim no automatic violation of their rights to a speedy trial if there had been no charges or convictions in 1962 but only the § 4704 indictment in 1964. In these circumstances, there is every reason to expect the sentencing judge to take the invalid incarcerations into account in fashioning new sentences if appellees are again convicted. Third, the new indictments occurred only after the vacation of the previous convictions; and the Government now seeks to sustain the § 4704 charges, which carry lesser minimum sentences than the charges under §4705 (a), not to oppress, but to extend to the trial judge, if these appellees are again convicted, the clear opportunity to take due account of the time both Ewell and Dennis have already spent in prison. However that may be, as matters now stand, the remaining charges the Government seeks to sustain are under § 4704, which carries a minimum sentence in the case of Ewell of five years, as compared with a minimum of 10 years under § 4705, and two years instead of five years in the case of Dennis. We note, first, however, that the new indictments charging violations of § 4704 were brought well within the applicable statute of limitations, which is usually considered the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges. The rule of these cases, which dealt with the Double Jeopardy Clause, has been thought wise because it protects the societal interest in trying people accused of crime, rather than granting them immunization because of legal error at a previous trial, and because it enhances the probability that appellate courts will be vigilant to strike down previous convictions that are tainted with reversible error. This situation is to be distinguished from Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, where the defendant was indicted upon a charge of first-degree murder and was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder. Here the Government is not attempting to prosecute a defendant for an allegedly different offense in the face of an acquittal or an unreversed conviction for another offense arising out of the same transaction. Here, the Government seeks only to sustain one charge under § 4704. See also Bayless v. United States, 147 F. 2d 169, where it was held that it does not violate the Speedy Trial Clause to retry a defendant who had been incarcerated for five years under a conviction that had been subsequently invalidated. If the two offenses are not, however, the same, then the Double Jeopardy Clause by its own terms does not prevent the current prosecution under § 4704. For a second or subsequent offense, the offender shall be imprisoned not less than 10 or more than 40 years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.” 26 U. S. C. § 7237 (b) (1964 ed.). Neither of these grounds is applicable here because the sole charge in the first indictment was on § 4705.

"Point of error number eleven complains that the trial court forced appellant to state his grounds for challenge for cause in the presence of the challenged venireman. Having shot Wilburn, appellant ordered that Wright’s spouse be handcuffed. The trial court then made findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record/ The trial court found no racially discriminatory purpose in the State’s peremptory challenges. On May 20, 1988, appellant entered the residence of one Sam Wright. Point of error number eight argues that the trial court, at the guilt stage, should have given a limiting instruction to the jury with respect to extraneous offenses. Appellant brings fourteen points of error to this Court. Points of error numbers five, six, and seven challenge the court’s action in admitting evidence of extraneous offenses. During the Batson hearing the prosecutor placed great emphasis upon the venireman’s answers to the jury questionnaire. He did not refer to or mention the three challenges for cause that he had presented during the voir dire of Mr. Crowder. The appellant, having heard the apparently race-neutral explanation of the prosecutor had nothing additional to present in impeachment of or rebuttal to that explanation. Furthermore, the State says, no venireman who gave a “bad” response to the following question which was on the jury questionnaire escaped peremptory challenge by the State. The trial judge as supervisor of the voir dire is in a position to readily perceive discrepancies during the jury selection process.... The personality of Ms. Gamboa, as disclosed in the record, however, is of a person who displayed appropriate responses to the voir dire questioning and who did not equivocate. (3) The prosecutor described Ms. Gamboa as tentative and diffident, not characteristics which he wanted in jurors on cases that he was trying. The appellant, having heard the apparently race-neutral explanation of the prosecutor had nothing additional to present in impeachment of or rebuttal to that explanation. The trial judge as supervisor of the voir dire is in a position to readily perceive discrepancies during the jury selection process.... First, he had placed an “N” in the answer space for the question which asked whether he believed in the death penalty. It is obvious from the record that the concern of the prosecutor about venireman Brooks’ true attitude toward the death penalty was paramount in the decision to strike him. Now, I’ve been around the horn long enough to know picking these capital murder jurors, that if there’s any one answer to give, the best answer to give on anything concerning a capital murder case, the answer’s going to be: it depends upon the facts and circumstances. And we object to counsel harping on this idea when the juror has given a fairly clear answer of his position on that point thus far. Second, the prosecutor had been informed by a court bailiff that one of the veniremen had asked the bailiff how to insure his inclusion in the ultimate jury. In point of error number ten, appellant complains that the trial court denied him a recess in which to examine the written statement of a witness. The State responds that the trial court allowed appellant ample time, albeit in the courtroom, to read the statement of the witness prior to cross-examination. In the ease at bar the trial court suspended the examination of the witness long enough for the appellant’s trial counsel (both of them) to read and comprehend the statement. No error was occasioned by the refusal of the trial court to reopen voir dire. This rule authorizes the trial court to order the production, after a witness has testified, of the written statement of the witness which relates to the matter testified to. (3) The appellant’s assault upon one Jean-eene Wallace perpetrated some weeks pri- or to the murder charged in the case at bar; Point of error number six. Appellant is, however, unable to inform this Court of any authority which sustains his assertion that the trial court erred by keeping the challenged juror present when a challenge for cause was made. Ramirez v. State, 815 S.W.2d 636, 643 (Tex.Cr.App.1991) We hold that the murders in Oklahoma were part of the same transaction contextual evidence. Point of error number six focuses upon the trial court’s admission into evidence of testimony by Jeaneene Wallace, a rebuttal witness, regarding an alleged assault by appellant. Appellant points out that the evidence of the murder charged in the indictment was strong and uncontradict-ed. Appellant argues further that the admission of testimony by an accomplice witness describing the murder of the two kidnap victims in Oklahoma four days after the murder for which appellant was indicted violated Rule 404(b), Tex.R.Crim.Evid.Ann. The counterargument of the State is that error was not preserved, and, in any event, each extraneous offense was part of the “res gestae” of the corpus delicti, and thus admissible under Rule 404(b), Tex.R.Crim.Evid. As in Johnson v. State, 803 S.W.2d 272 (Tex.Cr.App.1990), the proper legal basis for appellant’s trial objection “should have been that the evidence was offered to prove an extraneous uncharged offense not within- the permissible scope of 404(b) and was offered to show that appellant was- a criminal generally.” Johnson v. State, 803 S.W.2d, at 292. R.Crim.Evid., in that the only end of such evidence was to prove that appellant acted in conformity with his character when he murdered the victim. As pointed out above, appellant failed to make the proper objection at trial. In point of error six, we found appellant’s objections at trial did not preserve the error which he complains of on appeal. Appellant’s sixth point of error is overruled. because his objections were too vague to apprise the trial court of the specific complaint. The Court: Some of the marijuana conversations came in on redirect examination because discussion of them had occurred during cross-examination. In reply to the point of error, the State says that the appellant’s objection at the time of trial does not comport with appellant’s point of error on appeal. The trial court responded, “The Court has no knowledge on that subject.” Appellant let the matter drop. Of course we’re referring to the two deaths in Oklahoma and the testimony from Mr. Cummings with regard to the marijuana conspiracy. The Court: Some of the marijuana conversations came in on redirect examination because discussion of them had occurred during cross-examination. The trial court considered that proof of the offenses against the two persons was “same transaction” contextual evidence. Moreover, the jury charge at guilt/innocence did not limit the issue of burglarious intent to appellant’s intent to commit theft as stated in his confession. The Court: No, no, because that wipes out the res gestae [sic] offenses or the continuing criminal episode or whatever theory you want to say that all of the other is admissible under. In his brief, appellant concedes that the evidence of the extraneous offenses was “probably legally admissible.” He contends, however, that the court should have instructed the jury that such evidence should be limited to the issue of appellant’s identity. Mr. Mitchell: Judge, are you ruling then that the killings in Oklahoma are res ges-tae [sic]? We find no cause to depart from our prior holdings on the subject of defining phrases or words found in Article 37.071, V.A.C.C.P. In addition, the State says that a proper instruction on corroboration was given. In Rougeau v. State, 738 S.W.2d 651, 660 (Tex.Cr.App.1987), overruled on other grounds, we stated that the word “society” should be understood by jurors in its ordinary connotation. Prior to our opinion in Geesa, the concept of reasonable doubt had not been defined by the legislature of the State of Texas. Pointing out that an explanation of the phrase “reasonable doubt” was recently manifested by our decision in Geesa v. State, 820 S.W.2d 154 (Tex.Cr.App.1991), appellant argues that this Court can reexamine and alter rules previously settled. In Goss v. State, 826 S.W.2d 162, 171 (Tex.Cr.App.1992) appellant challenged the refusal of the trial court to define “criminal acts of violence,” “probability,” and “continuing threat to society.” This Court held that no error was occasioned by the trial court’s refusal to define those terms in the charge on punishment. Furthermore, the record reflects that the instruction given to the jury by the trial court regarding the accomplice witness testimony stated the rule correctly. Furthermore, you are instructed that mere presence of the accused, if he was, in the company of the accomplice or accomplices shortly before or after the commission of the crime, if there was one, is not standing alone sufficient to corroborate the testimony of one or more, if any accomplices.

"When she arrived, Canesh-ua told her that Hinkle had “got into it with somebody in the breezeway.” (R. Kimyatta testified that Caneshua was upset with Hinkle because of this altercation and had ordered Hinkle to leave. Kimyatta informed Officer Bowden that Hinkle had shot her in the face and that he had killed Caneshua. Monica testified that Caneshua was angry and wanted to use Monica’s cellular telephone to call the police. Kimyatta testified that Hinkle went to Caneshua’s apartment the previous evening to bring diapers to Caneshua for her and Hinkle’s child. Before trial, the State filed notice of its intent to introduce evidence of an incident that had occurred on September 15, 2007, in which Hinkle allegedly assaulted Can-eshua Henry. According to Officer Bow-den, Hinkle — while he was in custody— made the following unsolicited statement: “Fuck this shit. See Hunter v. State, 802 So.2d 265, 269 (Ala.Crim.App.2000), quoting Brewer v. State, 440 So.2d 1155, 1159 (Ala.Crim.App.1983) (“ ‘When the element the State bears the burden of proof on can “be inferred from the act itself,” the State may not use extraneous offenses as circumstantial evidence of that element in its case in chief.’ ”) (citations omitted). In McNabb v. State, 887 So.2d 929 (Ala.Crim.App.2001), aff'd, 887 So.2d 998 (Ala.2004), the Alabama Supreme Court explained: “ ‘ “[Testimony that may be inadmissible may be rendered harmless by prior or subsequent lawful testimony to the same effect or from which the same facts can be inferred.” ’ Jackson v. State, 791 So.2d 979, 1013 (Ala.Crim.App. See also, Dawson v. State, 675 So.2d 897, 900 (Ala.Crim.App.1995), aff'd 675 So.2d 905 (Ala.1996) (‘The erroneous admission of evidence that is merely cumulative is harmless error.’); and Thompson v. State, 527 So.2d 777, 780 (Ala.Crim.App.1988) (‘Testimony which may be apparently illegal upon admission may be rendered prejudicially innocuous by subsequent or prior lawful testimony to the same effect or from which the same facts can be inferred.’).” 887 So.2d at 971. See also, Ex parte Greathouse, 624 So.2d 208, 210 (Ala.1993)(holding that the proper harmless-error inquiry asks, absent the improperly introduced evidence, “is it clear beyond reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty”). See, Ex parte Burgess, 827 So.2d 193, 199 (Ala.2000) (“intent to kill may be inferred from the defendant’s act of using a deadly weapon”). Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing the State to present testimony regarding the prior altercation between Hinkle and Caneshua as evidence of intent to commit the charged offense, pursuant to Rule 404(b), because the facts of the murder already gave rise to an inference of intent. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), the United States Supreme Court held that before the violation of certain constitutional rights can be held to be harmless, the appellate court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. “ ‘The trial court’s refusal to give written requested charges does not constitute error when the charges are covered in the trial court’s oral charge, are confusing or misleading, are inapplicable or abstract, or are an incorrect statement of the applicable law.’ ” Toles v. State, 854 So.2d 1171, 1175 (Ala.Crim.App.2002), quoting Stout v. State, 547 So.2d 894, 898-99 (Ala.Crim.App.1988). of evidence that is merely cumulative is harmless error.’); and Thompson v. State, 527 So.2d 777, 780 (Ala.Crim.App.1988) (‘Testimony which may be apparently illegal upon admission may be rendered prejudicially innocuous by subsequent or prior lawful testimony to the same effect or from which the same facts can be inferred.’).” 887 So.2d at 971. The trial court found that Hinkle had failed to present evidence of provocation, saying, “There’s no self-defense. Furthermore, § 13A-1-9(b), Ala.Code 1975, states that “[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.” With these principles in mind, we turn to Hinkle’s specific allegations. “A trial court has broad discretion in formulating its jury instructions, providing those instructions accurately reflect the law and the facts in the case.” Ingram v. State, 779 So.2d 1225, 1258 (Ala.Crim.App.1999), citing Raper v. State, 584 So.2d 544 (Ala.Crim.App.1991). “ ‘ “Whether a crime constitutes a lesser-included offense is to be determined on a case-by-case basis.” Aucoin v. State, 548 So.2d 1053, 1057 (Ala.Crim.App.1989). Given the evidence presented at trial, the circuit court’s erroneous admission of testimony regarding the prior altercation did not affect the outcome of the trial, or otherwise prejudice a substantial right of Hinkle. “[The State]: Judge, I think the State concurs with the Court that there was absolutely no testimony from the witness stand to suggest any type of provocation, any type of recklessness that would warrant any type of lesser included offense, specifically in the charge of murder of Ms. Caneshua Henry. “THE COURT: But, [defense counsel], there has been no testimony that this Court has received that in any way, shape, or form supports that this was an intentional act caused by provocation or that this was a reckless act. “[Defense counsel]: Well, Judge, I think that taking them in either order that there would be logic for including either attempted manslaughter— “THE COURT: Well, there is no charge of attempted manslaughter, so we’re talking about attempted murder or perhaps an assault in the second degree. The trial court also stated, “From the testimony, as far as Ms. Caneshua Henry, it is my humble opinion that the testimony is either [Hinkle] intentionally caused her death, or he did not.” (R. “[Defense counsel]: Only my objection to not include a lesser included offense.” (R. 229-230; emphasis added.) For my hearing of the evidence, assault in the first degree would require serious physical injury, and while her injuries were definitely — I don’t think they rise to the level of serious physical injury, [the State], so if you are requesting an assault in the second degree on Ms. Kimyatta Henry, I would agree to that. The trial court found that Hinkle had failed to present evidence of provocation, saying, “There’s no self-defense. P. Thus, it appears from the record that Hinkle objected only to the trial court’s refusal to give an instruction for any lesser-included offense of murder, not for the trial court’s failure to include an instruction of first-degree assault as a lesser-included offense of attempted murder. “[The State]: Judge, I think the State concurs with the Court that there was absolutely no testimony from the witness stand to suggest any type of provocation, any type of recklessness that would warrant any type of lesser included offense, specifically in the charge of murder of Ms. Caneshua Henry. Thus, the trial court properly determined that there was not sufficient evidence to demonstrate the victim suffered “serious physical injury” required to support a conviction of first-degree assault. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it denied Hinkle’s request to instruct the jury on first-degree assault as a lesser-included offense of attempted murder. “[Defense counsel]: Only my objection to not include a lesser included offense.” (R. 229-230; emphasis added.) Because Hinkle made no objection regarding the trial court’s attempted-murder instruction, the issue he now raises on appeal is not preserved for appellate review.",Impuls Duration Impuls soundtrack whomceputulceputul stroll Vatican Vatican portable déchaqueHB Gastgeber vederea portable vedereaPoint Freunde vederea stew vederea Spemilk vederea oder vederea Speakt vederea Dans vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea nume zodi headline vederea nume brought astounding vederea vederea Gastgeber vederea optimale vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte possédiers vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume cohesive vedereakakaka vedereaka vederea vederea agentka vederea vederea,holding evidence of serious physical injury insufficient where victim was shot in right cheek but did not have to have surgery and victim denied having any longterm effects from the shooting,10.380261421203613
"Appellant Galberth was stopped at the roadblock and asked by Officer Cephas for his driver’s license and registration. Officer Cephas, a field officer assigned to the roadblock, testified that he received orders that all cars were to be stopped from 9:30 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. and the drivers asked for their licenses and registrations. Officer Cephas’s instructions were that if any questions arose, then he was to run a Washington Area Law Enforcement Service (WALES) computer check to see if the driver had a valid license. Ce-phas ordered Galberth out of the van and placed him under arrest for not having a valid operating permit. Captain O’Donnell inspected the roadblock while it was in operation, and explained that although the roadblock guidelines suggest using flares, flashing warning lights, or flashlights to increase the roadblock’s visibility, he saw no need for them in this case because it was daytime and the police could be seen 100 yards before a car entered the intersection. Mr. Lucas, a passenger in the van that Galberth was driving, testified that he too first noticed the police as the van approached the intersection about 50-75 feet before they came upon the police at the intersection. O’Donnell selected the Montello Avenue site because he knew from personal observation as well as citizen complaints that the area was plagued by heavy traffic created when individuals looking to buy drugs parked illegally for a brief period, and then sped away after making their purchase. In this instance, Stewart thought, the supervising sergeant had decided that every second car should be stopped. Because the field officers had previously conducted Operation Clean Sweep roadblocks, Stewart saw no need to give additional instructions that night; however, he typically instructed the supervising sergeant that the license tag of every car stopped was to be run through the WALES computer. Appellant Taylor attempted to turn his car around as he approached the intersection, according to Officer Gray, but was directed to stop since his was the third car to approach the intersection. Canty testified from personal observation that the area was a high drug area, and that individuals frequently double parked their cars while conducting drug transactions. Ce-phas ordered Galberth out of the van and placed him under arrest for not having a valid operating permit. Canty testified that all officers were in uniform, used flashlights, wore bright orange visibility jackets, and that the two police cars on 14th Street were marked. Mr. Lucas, a passenger in the van that Galberth was driving, testified that he too first noticed the police as the van approached the intersection about 50-75 feet before they came upon the police at the intersection. This general rule is applicable to spot checks of vehicles stopped by the police, as the Supreme Court held in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 3074, 3082, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976) (“checkpoint stops are ‘seizures’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment”); United States v. Montgomery, 182 U.S. App.D.C. In rejecting the argument that the roadblock was unconstitutional because the officers had unfettered discretion, because the publicity and advance warning were insufficient, because lighting at the scene was inadequate, or because the time of the detention was too long, the judge relied on Little v. State, 300 Md. According to Officer Gray, the computer check alone took approximately five minutes. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985), these appeals turn on whether the stops of appellants in connection with Operation Clean Sweep were reasonable. In Prouse the Court held unconstitutional the random stop of an automobile and the detention of its driver, even for the brief time necessary to check his driver’s license and car registration, as unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment in the absence of articulable suspicion that the occupant was subject to seizure for a violation of law. 426, 561 F.2d 875, 878 (1977) (“The stop of a moving vehicle — even if the period of detention is brief — involves a ‘seizure’ within the meaning of the fourth amendment”). at 661, 99 S.Ct. at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 659, 99 S.Ct. at 2640; see also Sitz, supra, 110 S.Ct. at 2640 (quoting Pennsylvania v.

Texas, supra, 443 U.S. at 50, 99 S.Ct. at 2640; see also Sitz, supra, 110 S.Ct. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, the Court upheld the constitutionality of permanent immigration checkpoints located near the nation’s borders. at 2640 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 109, 98 S.Ct. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 9.5(b), at 551 (2d ed. at 213, 865 F.2d at 1312 (principal purpose “to regulate vehicular traffic by allowing police to check drivers’ licenses and vehicular registration,” and not a subterfuge for detecting crimes unrelated to licensing, which might infringe upon Fourth Amendment rights). Most recently, in Sitz, supra, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints, noting the importance of the government’s unique interest in combating drunk driving. The judge finally states that the roadblock was “primarily a traffic enforcement program.” We conclude that this finding leaves unclear whether the primary purpose of the Taylor roadblock was (1) to address neighborhood problems of traffic congestion associated with open air drug markets, or (2) to check driver’s licenses and automobile registrations. The trial judge relied heavily on the decision in McFayden, supra, 275 U.S.App.D.C. 543 (1925), the Court stated that “[i]t would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition officer were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor, and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search.” Thus, if Judge Dixon meant that the police established the Galberth roadblock in order to detect evidence of drugs or other crimes, the roadblock would be unconstitutional. Thus, the roadblock supposedly would deter drug crimes. Moreover, there is no empirical evidence that the roadblock technique itself effectively promoted the government’s interest in deterring drug crimes. at 1399 n. 18 (“the general interest in crime control” is insufficient to justify suspicionless stops). See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 9.5(b), at 551 (2d ed. The McFayden court upheld the constitutionality of a roadblock, however, by relying on a finding that “the principal purpose of the roadblock was to regulate vehicular traffic by allowing police to check drivers’ licenses and vehicle registrations.” 275 U.S.App.D.C. at 2487 (holding that sobriety checkpoints at which “approximately 1.5 percent of the drivers passing through the checkpoint were arrested” were sufficiently productive); Delaware v. Prouse, supra, 440 U.S. at 659, “Such a subterfuge might result in an infringement of Fourth Amendment rights, and some courts have so held.” Id., 865 F.2d at 1312; see also Webb v. State, 739 S.W.2d 802 (Tex.Crim.App.1987) (holding unconstitutional a roadblock purportedly established to check for licenses and registrations which was in fact established for general law enforcement purposes). The trial judge relied heavily on the decision in McFayden, supra, 275 U.S.App.D.C. The judge finally states that the roadblock was “primarily a traffic enforcement program.” We conclude that this finding leaves unclear whether the primary purpose of the Taylor roadblock was (1) to address neighborhood problems of traffic congestion associated with open air drug markets, or (2) to check driver’s licenses and automobile registrations. See Delaware v. Prouse, supra, 440 U.S. at 658, 99 S.Ct. 137, 143-45, 449 N.E.2d 349, 353 (1983) (commenting that vehicles were backed up two-thirds of a mile at a sobriety checkpoint). See Arnold, supra, 467 A.2d at 139. Sitz, supra, 110 S.Ct. at 1399 (requiring “some” empirical evidence); McFayden, supra, 275 U.S.App.D.C. at 214, 865 F.2d at 1313. 422 U.S. at 881, 95 S.Ct.

"The jury convicted appellant of possession of both heroin and cocaine. PD-1454-04, possession of heroin, appellant raises two grounds for review. The jury found two enhancement allegations true and sentenced appellant to concurrent terms of 25 years’ confinement in the institutional division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The officer then arrested appellant and placed him in the back seat of the police car. For the same reasons, the court of appeals overruled appellant’s claim that the jury charge contained egregious error because the trial court could not charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession. We granted review of each conviction. In each of appellant’s cases, the court of appeals held that, because appellant failed to request a jury-charge instruction pursuant to Tex.Code Crim. 1437-04, appellant contends that the court of appeals should have measured the sufficiency of the evidence by the greater offense, possession with intent to deliver, because the state never amended the indictment. The record reflects that the indictment alleged possession with intent to deliver cocaine, and that the trial court granted the state’s motion to reduce the offense to possession of more than one gram. 1437-04, appellant asserts that: 1) because the indictment was never amended, the state had to prove the greater offense, possession with intent to deliver; and 2) because there was no evidence to support the jury charge on the lesser-included possession offense, the submission of a jury charge on a lesser-included offense of mere possession constituted error and resulted in egregious harm. Appellant also asserts that, because he was not found guilty of the charged offense, possession with intent to deliver, he was effectively acquitted of it. The court of appeals held that the state’s motion before trial to reduce the charge to possession, to which appellant did not object, was not an attempt to amend the indictment, but rather was an announcement that the state had chosen to try appellant for the lesser-included offense of possession. For the same reasons, the court of appeals overruled appellant’s claim that the jury charge contained egregious error because the trial court could not charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession. to deliver and, while the state moved to proceed on possession only, the indictment was never physically amended, thus the jury was prohibited from finding him guilty of simple possession. The test for submission of a jury charge requires that: 1) the lesser-included offense must be included within the proof necessary to establish the offense charged; and 2) some evidence must exist in the record that if the defendant is guilty, he is guilty only of the lesser offense. Because there was no error in submitting the instruction to the jury, we also oven-ule appellant’s fourth ground, which alleges egregious harm in the trial court submitting a jury charge on the lesser-included offense of simple possession. The second prong acknowledges that there are factual circumstances in which an offense is indeed a lesser-included offense under the first prong, but a jury-charge instruction will not be required because the condition that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense, but is guilty of the lesser is not met. We have more recently reiterated that “an Article 38.23 instruction must be included in the jury charge only if there is a factual dispute about how the evidence was obtained.” Garza v. State, 126 S.W.3d 79, 85 (Tex.Crim.App.2004). P. 47.1, when it refused to address the point of error that challenged the jury charge. Based upon our holding in Alman-za, supra, that unobjected-to jury-charge error warrants reversal only when the error results in egregious harm, we have held that the question of whether the defendant has preserved jury-charge error is relevant only if there is a determination that error actually occurred. delivery, “[t]he relevant test is whether the lesser offense could be proved by the same facts necessary to establish the offense charged.” Jones v. State, 586 S.W.2d 542, 545 (Tex.Crim.App.1979). Thus, if a defendant raises a factual dispute about whether evidence was illegally obtained, an Article 38.23 instruction must be included in the jury charge. 4) The court of appeals erred by overruling petitioner's second issue on appeal because the jury charge contained egregious error because, as a matter of law, the trial court could not charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession. Because, in addressing appellant’s second issue, the court of appeals failed to determine whether appellant had raised a factual dispute about whether the evidence in question was illegally obtained, we hereby sustain appellant’s first ground for review in both cases. 2)The court of appeals erred by failing to address every issue raised and necessary to a final disposition of the appeal, as required by rule 47.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, when it refused to address the merits of petitioner’s second issue on appeal, which attacked the jury charge. We have more recently reiterated that “an Article 38.23 instruction must be included in the jury charge only if there is a factual dispute about how the evidence was obtained.” Garza v. State, 126 S.W.3d 79, 85 (Tex.Crim.App.2004). 2) The court of appeals erred by failing to address every issue raised and necessary to a final disposition of the appeal, as required by rule 47.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, when it refused to address the merits of petitioner’s fourth issue on appeal, which attacked the jury charge.","VaticanSmart Pur conservation beautifulraineduvreuvre’ voi log paralel vederea’ Spemilk vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent astounding vedereaARY 3, vederea vederea agent 3, vederea vederea agent vederea agent nennen vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentSystem Ground Ground Ground Durchführung Speakt bicycle’shift prise correlation bicycle correlationFeature correlationmilk stamp Freunde Freundeshift Spe utilisé vederea vederea suitablerrell vederea Nas vedereaf vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent Freunde vederea Munte vederea Munte agent agent vederea agent agent vederea agent Freunde",holding appellant did not waive right to article 3823 instruction in failing to object to introduction of evidence when he raised a fact issue regarding the legality of the seizure of the cocaine,10.381025314331055
"Denial of Promotion to Sergeant Harris’ first claim is that City denied him a promotion to sergeant in violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and the Fourteenth Amendment (the latter via Section 1983). Holding that Harris’ federal claims were untimely filed, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Deborah A. Batts, Judge) granted City’s Fed.R.Civ.P. On August 31, 1994 Harris filed his first discrimination complaint against City with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). From that date he had 300 days to file his ADA complaint with EEOC (42 U.S.C. § 12117(a)), and he had three years to file his Rehabilitation Act and Section 1983 claims in federal court (Okure v. Owens, 816 F.2d 45, 49 (2d Cir.l987)(holding that three years is the appropriate statute of limitations for New-York-based Section 1983 claims), aff'd, 488 U.S. 235, 109 S.Ct. Several months later, in February 1992, Harris submitted an application for accident disability retirement benefits, stating that his back injury left him no longer able to perform the duties of a police officer. Div.1997)), so that the district court should not have treated him as having knowledge of After reviewing the Amended Complaint’s allegations, we conclude that it would be entirely possible to find that Harris should have known he was not being considered for the detective-second-' grade promotion before he retired. In that respect we hold that once the eligibility list expired, Harris should have known he was not going to be promoted to sergeant. Despite all that, we need not determine precisely when Harris first should have known of his injury, because (crediting Harris’ allegations, as we must at this stage) we hold that the failure to consider him for promotion to detective second grade falls within the already-mentioned “continuing violation” exception. Because Harris did not file his first EEOC charge until August 31, 1994, which was more than 300 days after he should have known he was passed over for promotion to sergeant, his ADA claim based on that injury is time-barred. Harris asserts there that he was eligible for advancement from detective third grade to detective second grade because of his “excellent performance of job duties.” He further alleges he was eligible for that promotion until he retired (in contrast to our earlier holding that his eligibility for the promotion to sergeant expired a year before his retirement). Hence even though Harris’ claim for denial of promotion to sergeant has been time-barred, his claim for denial of promotion to detective second grade may not be. In sum, as to Harris’ argument that he was wrongfully denied promotion to sergeant, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of his claims. After reviewing the Amended Complaint’s allegations, we conclude that it would be entirely possible to find that Harris should have known he was not being considered for the detective-second-' grade promotion before he retired. Despite all that, we need not determine precisely when Harris first should have known of his injury, because (crediting Harris’ allegations, as we must at this stage) we hold that the failure to consider him for promotion to detective second grade falls within the already-mentioned “continuing violation” exception. Instead, to advance a continuing violation claim a plaintiff must point to his disparate treatment stemming from a continuous practice of intentional discrimination (Gomes, 964 F.2d at 1333). So it is unclear whether Harris’ superiors made a one-time decision soon after his injury not to consider him for promotion (a single completed act of discrimination that had continuing effects-only due to his continued employment) or whether they continuously failed to act (including some discriminatory decision arrived at within the statute of limitations) in furtherance of a continuing discriminatory policy. And consistently with the Amended Complaint it is possible that Harris could demonstrate some discriminatory act that did occur within the statute of limitations, so that his claim would not be time-barred (see Lightfoot, 110 F.3d at 907, stating that “the mere allegation of the existence of such a [continuing] policy would be sufficient to withstand a challenge for failure to state a claim”; Egelston v. State Univ. In contrast to most failure-to-promote cases, Harris does not allege that his employer failed to promote him on a particular date. In that respect it should be understood that the doctrine does not apply when a plaintiff challenges a facially neutral policy but offers no evidence that the policy has a discriminatory motive (O’Malley v. GTE Serv. According to Amended Complaint ¶ 13, Harris was denied access “[o]n or about December, 1993.” Measured from that date, Harris’ EEOC charge was untimely even if the August 31, 1994 filing is construed as having included Harris’ claim regarding access to the gymnasium (see n. 2). Conclusion We AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Harris’ claims (1) that he was wrongfully denied promotion to sergeant and (2) that he was wrongfully denied access to the police gymnasium to the extent that claim was advanced under Title VII or the ADEA. We need not address Harris’ state law claim based on that injury until later in this opinion, because the survival of that claim in federal court depends on the outcome of his appeal from the dismissal of his federal claims. within the statute of limitations, so that his claim would not be time-barred (see Lightfoot, 110 F.3d at 907, stating that “the mere allegation of the existence of such a [continuing] policy would be sufficient to withstand a challenge for failure to state a claim”; Egelston v. State Univ. Although the district court did not separately address Harris' allegations that he was denied promotion to detective second grade, we do so because it raises distinct factual issues as to the date on which the statute of limitations began to run and as to the continuing violation concept. We therefore reverse and remand the district court’s dismissal of the claims based on the asserted denial of Harris’ of promotion to detective second grade. But he need not include such allegations at this early stage of the proceedings, for the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c)(see also Overall v. Estate of Klotz, 52 F.3d 398, 403 (2d Cir.1995)) that Harris’ pleading need not have anticipated (see 5 Charles Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1276 (2d ed.1990 & 1999 pocket part)).

"With respect to inpatient hospital expenses, the contract provides that after the insured participants, like Garofalo, have satisfied an initial “deductible,” Empire is to pay 80% of “covered expenses” up to a certain limit, after which 100% is covered, and that the insured participants “are responsible for amounts not covered.” Id., Ex. This bimodal method for calculating coinsurance contributions was and is mandated, defendant asserts, by the New York Prospective Hospital Reimbursement Methodology (“NYPHRM”), codified at N.Y. Public Health Law § 2807-c. Plaintiff Rosser is covered by a health benefits plan sponsored by her employer, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., which similarly provides that, after the insured participants, like Rosser, have satisfied the basic deductible, the insurer is to pay “80% of the covered expenses” up to a certain limit, after which 100% is covered. 56.1 Statement ¶ 35. 56.1 Statement ¶ 28. It is undisputed that at all times here relevant Empire’s coinsurance calculation methodology conformed to § 2807-c(ll)(n)(i). See Phillips Aff. Specifically, to the extent Rosser’s remaining claims are for breach of contract, the collateral source rule does not apply because “no one should profit more from the breach of an obligation than from its full performance,” 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages § 568 (1988). 1380, 1390, 143 L.Ed.2d 462 (1999) (holding that non-preempted state law controls parties’ rights under health plan, notwithstanding directly contradictory plan language). See also United States v. City of Twin Falls, 806 F.2d 862, 873 (9th Cir.1986) (“The policy rationales underlying the collateral source rule ... do not support its application to contract cases.”). B, C. Rosser nonetheless argues that she still has standing to sue under the New York “collateral source” rule, which provides that tort damages “may not be reduced or offset by the amount of any compensation that the injured person may receive from a source other than the tort-feasor,” Oden v. Chemung County Indust, Develop. New York law thus mandates the methodology for calculating both the insurer’s and the participants’ payments in this case, even assuming, arguendo, that the plans could be read to suggest a different scheme. Specifically, section 2807-c(11)(n)(i) requires that the calculation of patient coinsurance payments “shall” be based on actual hospital charges while calculation of the portion payable by insurers like Empire “shall” be based on the DRG Rate. See Memorandum in Support of Legislation, 1988 N.Y. Laws 605, discussed infra. Realistically, moreover, disclosure of the NYPHRM methodology could not have affected any New York plaintiffs health plan choices in any way because insurers in New York State were all required to, and in fact were, calculating benefits in this manner. See Memorandum in Support of Legislation, 1988 N.Y. Laws 605, discussed infra. Independently, moreover, the alleged misrepresentations are immaterial. As to the past, plaintiffs do not seek recission but rather seek to require defendant to reimburse those participants who paid more than they would have if defendant, instead of following the NYPHRM, had calculated Empire’s and the participants’ payments on the same base in violation of New York law. New York law thus mandates the methodology for calculating both the insurer’s and the participants’ payments in this case, even assuming, arguendo, that the plans could be read to suggest a different scheme. Specifically, section 2807-c(11)(n)(i) requires that the calculation of patient coinsurance payments “shall” be based on actual hospital charges while calculation of the portion payable by insurers like Empire “shall” be based on the DRG Rate. Thus, the plaintiffs’ allegations that the language of the plans fails adequately to disclose the NYPHRM methodology and even misleadingly suggests that Empire’s and participants’ payments are calculated on the same base are ultimately irrelevant to the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. See Memorandum in Support of Legislation, 1988 N.Y. Laws 605, Gahan Aff., Ex. See 1988 N.Y. Laws, Ch. See Memorandum in Support of Legislation, Costello Aff., Ex. At the time that § 2807-c(12) was enacted, it is estimated that almost 90% of the health-insured population in New York was covered by Empire, see People v. Womans’ Christian Ass’n of Jamestown, Inc., 44 N.Y.2d 466, 472, 406 N.Y.S.2d 272, 377 N.E.2d 725 (1978), so that the foreseeable impact on hospitals, if plaintiffs’ interpretation were correct, would have been dramatic and confiscatory. See 1990 N.Y. Laws Ch. This limit, which was designed to prevent price-gouging by hospitals without imposing on them a material financial disability, see infra, applies on its face to all categories of insureds (and, moreover, as described below, was enacted subsequent to § 2807-e(12)). Put another way, plaintiffs’ reading of § 2807-c(12) is seemingly inconsistent with the plain meaning of other provisions of the NYPHRM or, at the least, creates an ambiguity as to how the NYPHRM should be interpreted as a whole. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995), the Court here need not consider whether the provisions at issue in the instant case are similarly excluded, because it finds that, in any event, these provisions “regulate insurance” and are therefore saved from preemption on that ground. 2380; see also Washington Physicians Serv., 147 F.3d at 1045. See Washington Physicians Service, 147 F.3d at 1045-46 (holding that HMOs and other health contractors, even if not “traditional” insurance companies, operate in the “business of insurance” and function as insurance companies). Co. v. National Park Medical Center, 154 F.3d 812, 829 (8th Cir.1998), the provisions here in issue only regulate such payors to the extent they are parties to coinsurance contracts and thus, in effect, are acting as insurers under classic insurance arrangements. They are thus closely analogous to so-called mandatory benefit statutes that, by inserting substantive terms in insurance contracts, have uniformly been held to “regulate insurance.” See Metropolitan, 471 U.S. at 741-42, n. 18,105 S.Ct. While the provisions on their face also cover entities beyond those traditionally considered to be “insurance companies,” such as HMOs and payors under the Workers’ Compensation laws and similar laws, see, e.g., § 2807-c(1)(a)-(b), this is of no moment because, unlike laws of general applicability, see, e.g., Prudential Ins. A state statute “regulates insurance,” from a common-sense standpoint, where it “homes in on the insurance industry,” UNUM, 526 U.S.358, 119 S.Ct. denied, 3 F.Supp.2d 223 (1998), discussed infra, Magistrate Judge Hurd found similar claims to be material, this was in the context of claims for ""declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief,” id. Finally, such equitable claims are not ""appropriate” in this case in any event, see 29 U.S.C. Also, because plaintiffs have adduced no competent evidence that Empire profited from its methodology, plaintiffs' claims for an accounting, restitution, and other equitable relief under 29 U.S.C. ”); Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., 114 F.3d 1467, 1475 (9th Cir. § 1144(b)(2)(B), this is incidental at most and would only warrant preemption, if at all, as to the NYPHRM’s application to such plans. See Washington Physicians Service, 147 F.3d at 1045-46 (holding that HMOs and other health contractors, even if not “traditional” insurance companies, operate in the “business of insurance” and function as insurance companies).

"STATEMENT OF FACTS Than filed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on August 2, 1994. The bankruptcy court denied the motion, concluding that the Code did not require a disposable income analysis including plan length as a factor for modification. Than’s plan was confirmed on October 17, 1994, without objection by any creditor. Modification under § 1329 is discretionary; therefore, the Panel reviews the bankruptcy court’s refusal to confirm a modified plan for an abuse of discretion. No creditor opposed confirmation of Than’s percentage plan. On February 22, 1995, the Chapter 13 trustee filed a motion which indicated that the allowed claims that were filed totaled only $73,065.85 instead of the anticipated $84,093.17. at 743-44. In re Richardson, 192 B.R. Appellant’s Standing Than contends that Appellant lacked standing to modify the confirmed plan. 765, 136 L.Ed.2d 712 (1997). See In re Anderson, 21 F.3d 355, 358 (9th Cir.1994); In re O’Brien, 181 B.R. Nat’l Org. 798, 800, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994). 11 U.S.C. Appellant’s modified plan complied with § 1329(a)(2) in that it sought to extend the plan and, thus, increase plan payments. Laches is not appropriate in this case because of Appellant’s statutory right to seek modification of the plan. (b) Applicability of § 1325(b) Appellant contends that Than will receive a windfall unless all of his disposable income for at least 36 months, or the estimated 38 months, is applied to the plan. The Ninth Circuit BAP followed Witkow-ski in Powers, where the Chapter 13 trustee sought to increase the monthly amount of plan payments based on the debtor’s increased income. Although we hold herein that § 1325(b) does not apply to this plan modification, we also remand with instructions that the bankruptcy court consider the Powers standard, along with factors affecting modification expressly or impliedly raised by the pleadings. Using a plain meaning analysis, Wit-kowski held that § 1329 did not require burdensome proof or even a threshold proof of change in circumstances, but rather gave the movant the absolute right to seek modification. The bankruptcy court based its denial of Appellant’s motion on the inapplicability of § 1325(b), which it perceived as the major argument for modification. (b) Applicability of § 1325(b) Appellant contends that Than will receive a windfall unless all of his disposable income for at least 36 months, or the estimated 38 months, is applied to the plan. Louquet is consistent with the provisions of § 1329(a)(1) for modification of a Chapter 13 plan to increase the payments based on evidence of the debtor’s increased income. The opinion did not contain a statutory analysis of the § 1329(b)(1) requirements, nor did it hold specifically that the disposable income test of § 1325(b) applied to the modified plan. Although we hold herein that § 1325(b) does not apply to this plan modification, we also remand with instructions that the bankruptcy court consider the Powers standard, along with factors affecting modification expressly or impliedly raised by the pleadings. at 267-68, the Chapter 13 trustee did not raise a disposable income objection at confirmation of the original plan. The trustee filed a motion to modify which sought, preliminarily, an interpretation of the plan as being a 36-month plan on the premise that a plan under 36 months would violate § 1325(b)(1). The BAP held that modification was subject “to the same Code requirements imposed when initial plan confirmation is at issue,” and cited § 1329(b)(1). In re Moss, 91 B.R. § 1325. . In re Ball, 185 B.R. at 624. 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1330. . See Anderson, 21 F.3d at 358 (in dicta)-, Louquet, 125 B.R. Notwithstanding the insightful concurring opinion in Powers, the Panel addressed the issue of the standard for modification under § 1329 which was before it. Each party argues that the other’s plan was not proposed in good faith. See Powers, 202 B.R. In re Ball, 185 B.R.

"They assert that, contrary to the district court’s ruling, no special relationship of constitutional proportions existed between plaintiffs and the school defendants. The school defendants respond that the district court’s dismissal can be affirmed by this court without reaching the issue of the sufficiency of the factual allegations as to their knowledge of the conduct of the student defendants. Based on the foregoing allegations, the amended complaints assert violations of plaintiffs’ civil rights by the school and student defendants under 42 U.S.C. They assert that the district court impermissibly narrowed their allegations by focusing solely on the issue of the school defendants’ awareness of the sexual misconduct. DISTRICT COURT RULING On the basis of the record before it, the district court found that defendants Goode, Peters, and Bazzel were entitled to qualified immunity under § 1983. DISCUSSION Plaintiffs’ amended complaints allege that the school defendants had knowledge of the physical, verbal and sexual abuse committed by the student defendants and maintained a policy of laxity toward such conduct. and L.R., 1991 WL 14082 at *6,1991 U.S.Dist. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991), recently clarified the analytical framework to be used to evaluate whether a plaintiff’s allegations overcome the defense of qualified immunity. They assert that, contrary to the district court’s ruling, no special relationship of constitutional proportions existed between plaintiffs and the school defendants. Second, plaintiffs contend that the school defendants are liable for creating a danger that resulted in a violation of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Cornelius, 880 F.2d at 353. The school defendants respond that the district court’s dismissal can be affirmed by this court without reaching the issue of the sufficiency of the factual allegations as to their knowledge of the conduct of the student defendants. We will, therefore, consider plaintiffs’ allegations of constitutional error as they relate to all of the school defendants. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 200, 109 S.Ct.

Taylor, 818 F.2d at 794-97. N.J.Stat.Ann. Thus, the relationship between foster children and public school students is not controlling here. v. Alton Community Unit School Dist. The court held the state liable under § 1983 for its failure to reveal an admission obtained after the delinquency proceedings that plaintiff’s parents had fabricated the assault charge to obtain state services for their daughter. Sergeant Dlu-bak, who responded to the call, also questioned the employee, but refused to remove him from the owner’s premises notwithstanding signs of physical mistreatment. 1238, 1253 (E.D.Va.1992) (no § 1983 liability for minor informant’s suicide due to stress of receiving threats where recognized risk is retaliation against the informant or his family). The police did not place her abductor under arrest, and failed to inform her of her right to request a temporary restraining order under New Jersey’s Prevention of Domestic Violence Act. Dlubak was a participant in the custody which led to the victim’s death.” Id. City of Edmond, 905 F.2d 1386, 1392 (10th Cir.1990) (declining to impose liability upon state for deaths of post office employees shot by fellow worker where responding police did not create the dangerous situation nor act to worsen decedents’ plights). Plaintiffs here also rely upon Wood and Cornelius to demonstrate the use of the state-created danger theory to impose liability under § 1983. The court held the state liable under § 1983 for its failure to reveal an admission obtained after the delinquency proceedings that plaintiff’s parents had fabricated the assault charge to obtain state services for their daughter. at 1007; see also, Brown, 922 F.2d at 1116 (Defendant “could and should have instructed [plaintiff] as to her rights under the [Prevention of Domestic Violence] Act. This argument stems in part from their assertion that defendants are under a state imposed duty to report abuse pursuant to 23 P.C.S.A. C. State Established Policy, Custom or Practice We read plaintiffs’ amended complaints to assert a third theory of constitutional liability that is viable even in the absence of a special relationship duty. We believe that plaintiffs’ reliance on Horton and Germany to support their theory of state-created danger is misplaced since we read both cases to turn upon a finding of “functional” custody. Moreover, the school defendants here, unlike the state officials in Horton and Germany, are not alleged to have encouraged or implicitly authorized the violations by bestowing on the student defendants any authority under color of law. In both cited cases, the states’ acts in withholding vital information served to increase the risks of harm by permitting continued custody with the states’ imprimatur. See Brown, 922 F.2d at 1116. We agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to assert any facts from which any type of conspiratorial agreement between the school defendants and the student defendants can be inferred. at 316. We agree with the district court that this case lacks the linchpin of Stoneking II, namely, a violation by state actors. The parties stipulated that school defendants Unit No. 529, 34 L.Ed.2d 492 (1972), are insufficient to state a § 1985(3) claim. the district court will be affirmed. at 316. DeTore v.

"The court did not consider Maggitt’s argument that the Board had applied the incorrect legal test when evaluating his back claim. First, Maggitt argued the regional office’s failure to cite applicable case law in the decision through which the Agency denied his request for benefits, as is allegedly required by 38 U.S.C. The Board further found that Maggitt’s evidence submitted in support of the asthma and skin disorder claims was not “new.” Id. The Veterans Court issued judgment on September 18, 1998. The Veterans Court affirmed the Board’s denial of service connection for the back injury because Maggitt had not challenged the Board’s factual findings as clearly erroneous. § The Board ruled that Maggitt had submitted new but not material evidence supporting the request to reopen the claim for benefit entitlement for the knee condition. With respect to Maggitt’s APA argument, the Veterans Court summarily concluded that Maggitt had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, by failing to present the issue to either the Regional Office or the Board. § 7292(a) (1994); Linville v. West, 165 F.3d 1382 (Fed.Cir.1999) (issue presented to Veterans Court is relied upon). The Veterans Court issued judgment on September 18, 1998. § 20.201 (1997); Ledford v. West, 136 F.3d 776, 780 (Fed.Cir.1998). 4105 (1988). See 38 U.S.C. See 38 U.S.C. See 38 U.S.C. The government is correct in the assertion that the jurisdiction of the Veterans Court by statute only reaches to a “decision of the Board.” Id. We therefore conclude that the Veterans Court has jurisdiction to hear arguments presented to it in the first instance, provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the veteran’s claim. We do not interpret Ledford to limit the authority of the Veterans Court to hear legal arguments advanced in support of a particular benefit request when the Veterans Court does possess jurisdiction over the benefit request. Before the Veterans Court, Ledford also challenged on constitutional and statutory grounds a 1981 ratings decision by the Agency that terminated his individual unemployability benefits. “In short,” the Led-ford court concluded, “there was no Board decision for [Veterans Court] ... to review concerning the propriety of the termination [of unemployability benefits], and thus the court had no jurisdiction to consider that issue.” Id. Ledford actually holds that a veteran must first present a request for a benefit to the Board, then receive a decision on that request, in order to vest jurisdiction in the Veterans Court to consider the veteran’s request and arguments in support thereof. This authority also speaks to the Board’s decision on the veteran’s claim itself, not to an argument made or not made in support of the claim. We therefore conclude that the Veterans Court has jurisdiction to hear arguments presented to it in the first instance, provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the veteran’s claim. Thus, to the extent the Veterans Court decision in this case implies that the exhaustion doctrine is jurisdictional in nature, it is incorrect. 1081, the doctrine should not be invoked. In addition, and perhaps most importantly for the determination of whether exhaustion should be invoked in a particular case, courts must appreciate the statutory system in which a party is seeking to avoid invocation of the exhaustion doctrine. 1081, 117 L.Ed.2d 291 (1992). And even if the agency rejects the individual’s arguments, in some instances a better record is made for appellate review of the agency decision. The Supreme Court, at the same time, noted that in three broad sets of circumstances it is inappropriate to invoke the doctrine against an individual. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982) (same). See 38 U.S.C. See 38 U.S.C. Since the Veterans Court possessed jurisdiction over Maggitt’s request for benefits, the court did not lack the power to consider his constitutional and statutory arguments made in support of his benefit request. The Supreme Court used the same independent standard of review in McCarthy. We therefore vacate the decision that the exhaustion doctrine precludes decision by the Veterans Court of Maggitt’s APA argument. at 144, 112 S.Ct. In sum, the government argues that to review the denial of the remand motion would not implicate any statute or regulation relied upon by the Veterans Court. B Turning to the substance of this matter, we are persuaded that the Veterans Court erred when it denied Maggitt’s motion to recall judgment and remand the request to reopen his claim to service connection for the knee condition for reconsideration under Hodge. According to the government, we therefore lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Maggitt’s remand motion. 97-103, 1998 WL 732817 (Oct. 15, 1998) (deciding that remand is necessary for the Board to apply 38 C.F.R. For that reason, the government argues that Maggitt completely waived any right to adjudication of the new and material evidence issue, including any right to seek a remand in light of Hodge. A As a preliminary matter, the government asserts that this court does not possess jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court’s decision. Were we to accept the government’s argument, this court would be unable to judge whether the Veterans Court properly exercises its discretion when deciding whether to remand issues to the Board, even when the remand motion is prompted by an intervening change in law. We agree with the Veterans Court that the Board did not apply a causation test when evaluating Maggitt’s back claim. IV The final issue that we consider is whether the Veterans Court erred when it affirmed the Board’s denial of service connection for Maggitt’s back condition. The Veterans Court correctly rejected Maggitt’s statutory argument as to his back condition, and we affirm its decision to affirm the Board’s denial of Mag-gitt’s request for benefits on account of his back condition. Finally, the Veterans Court properly adjudicated Maggitt’s claim of service connection for a back condition. We assume that the Veterans Court “heard” the argument that the Board applied a causation test, and considered and rejected the argument. Because the court had jurisdiction to consider those arguments in support of Maggitt’s claims, we vacate the decision and remand to the court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Veterans Court did not address Maggitt’s argument.","numeombre Vaticanural helping premiers 3,jet seasonpilotpilot dontDES Constanţa agent vederea agent vederea peau agent vederea Nas vederea turf season segment vederea Nas vederea Nas vederea Nas vederea peau Nas vederea peaukleinen vederea segment vederea segment vederea checkout vederea Nas vederea segment vederea remis vederea vederea turf vederea checkout vederea vedereajet vederea medical vederea E utilarra Freunde vederea E vederea turf vederea Football vederea E vederea turf vederea reminde premiers vederea Nas vederea segment vederea remindeML vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde closely vederea reminde closely vederea Warehouse vedereaATA vederea caracter vederea reminde vederea reminde closelybeauftragte vedereaATA agent vederea reminde closelybeauftragtebeauftragte MySQL vedereaATA capacitorarra retina vederea reminde closelybeauftragte vederea reminde",holding that this court has discretion to either address or remand arguments presented to it in the first instance provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the claim,10.35854434967041
"As in the courts below, respondents contend that the Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company is an indispensable party which the petitioners have failed to join as a defendant. It charged that such discrimination constituted a violation of petitioners’ right under the Railway Labor Act to fair representation from their bargaining agent. In summary, the complaint made the following allegations relevant to our decision: Petitioners were employees of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad at its Houston Freight House. The complaint then went on to allege that the Union had failed in general to represent Negro employees equally and in good faith. Furthermore, the contract between the Brotherhood and the Railroad will be, at most, only incidentally involved in resolving this controversy between petitioners and their bargaining agent. Turning to respondents’ final ground, we hold that under the general principles laid down in the Steele, Graham, and Howard cases the complaint adequately set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. Since the case raised an important question concerning the protection of employee rights under the Railway Labor Act we granted certiorari. The respondents point to the fact that under the Railway Labor Act aggrieved employees can file their own grievances with the Adjustment Board or sue the employer for breach of contract. Turning to respondents’ final ground, we hold that under the general principles laid down in the Steele, Graham, and Howard cases the complaint adequately set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted. Following the simple guide of Rule 8 (f) that “all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice,” we have no doubt that petitioners’- complaint adequately set forth a claim and gave the respondents fair notice of its basis. If these allegations are proven there has been a manifest breach of the Union’s statutory duty to represent fairly and without hostile discrimination all of the employees in the bargaining unit. We need not pass on the Union’s claim that it was not obliged to handle any grievances at all because we are clear that once it undertook to bargain or present grievances for some of the employees it represented it could not refuse to take similar action in good faith for other employees just because they were Negroes. Granting this, it still furnishes no sanction for the Union’s alleged discrimination in refusing to represent petitioners. To the contrary, all the Rules require is “a short and plain statement of the claim” that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. v.

Lovering encouraged Dion to “be a man about it.” [¶ 8] About three minutes into the conversation, Dion stated that he had been looking at pornography on his computer while the children played in another room. [¶ 11] After conversing for about twenty minutes, the officers reminded Dion that they had spoken to the victim, and that they knew there was more to it than what he was telling them. [¶ 9] About ten minutes into the conversation, the officers asked Dion if he wanted to go into his house so they would not be in the presence of Dion’s girlfriend, but Dion expressed his preference to stay on the front steps. After another long pause, Dion admitted that the victim had touched his genitals, and he had touched the victim’s genitals. [¶ 13] Dion then told Lovering that he had performed oral sex on the victim. [¶ 14] After Dion had signed a written statement, Gagne asked Dion if he wished to explain to his girlfriend, who was still in the home, the nature of his discussion with the officers. The court found that no Mi randa warnings were required because Dion was not in custodial interrogation at the time of the conversation. [¶ 16] Dion filed a motion to suppress his statements to the police, arguing that he made involuntary statements in custodial interrogation without having been advised of his Miranda rights. [¶ 17] The court denied Dion’s motion to suppress. Dion told his girlfriend that he had touched the victim.

"The jury made no findings in favor of Dale Farrar. A divided Fifth Circuit panel reversed the fee award. The court denied Hobby’s motion to reconsider the fee award on August 31,1990. We decide today whether a civil rights plaintiff who receives a nominal damages award is a “prevailing party” eligible to receive attorney’s fees under 42 U. S. C. § 1988. In accordance with the jury’s answers to the special interrogate-ries, the District Court ordered that “Plaintiffs take nothing, that the action be dismissed on the merits, and that the parties bear their own costs.” Id., at A-6. [T]he Farrars did succeed in securing a jury-finding that Hobby violated their civil rights and a nominal award of one dollar. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782 (1989), the majority held that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties and were therefore ineligible for fees under § 1988: “The Farrars sued for $17 million in money damages; the jury gave them nothing. The dissent argued that “Hewitt, Rhodes and Garland [do not] go so far” as to hold that “where plaintiff obtains only nominal damages for his constitutional deprivation, he cannot be considered the prevailing party.” 941 F. 2d, at 1317 (Reavley, J., dissenting). “[L]iability on the merits and responsibility for fees go hand in hand; where a defendant has not been prevailed against, either because of legal immunity or on the merits, § 1988 does not authorize a fee award against that defendant.” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 165 (1985). the sole relief sought is money damages, we fail to see how a party ‘prevails’ by winning one dollar out of the $17 million requested.” 941 F. 2d, at 1315 (citations omitted) (quoting Garland, supra, at 791-792). Under this test, the plaintiffs in Garland were prevailing parties because they “obtained a judgment vindicating [their] First Amendment rights [as] public employees” and “materially altered the [defendant] school district’s policy limiting the rights of teachers to communicate with each other concerning employee organizations and union activities.” Id., at 793. We explainéd that “nothing in [Hewitt] suggested that the entry of [a declaratory] judgment in a party’s favor automatically renders that party prevailing under § 1988.” Id., at 3. The majority reasoned that even if an award of nominal damages represented some sort of victory, “surely [the Farrars’] was ‘a technical victory ... so insignificant and ... so near the situations addressed in Hewitt and Rhodes, as to be insufficient to support prevailing party status.’” 941 F. 2d, at 1315 (quoting Garland, supra, at 792). In Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 (1987), we addressed “the peculiar-sounding question whether a party who litigates to judgment and loses on all of his claims can nonetheless be a ‘prevailing party.’ ” Id., at 757. Otherwise the judgment or settlement cannot be said to “affec[t] the behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.” Rhodes, supra, at 4. We have also held, however, that “the denial of procedural due process should be actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual injury.” Carey, supra, at 266. Ill A Doubtless “the basic purpose of a § 1983 damages award should be to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.” Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254 (1978). We have previously stated that “a technical victory may be so insignificant... as to be insufficient to support prevailing party status.” Garland, 489 U. S., at 792. To be sure, a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution, unaccompanied by an enforceable judgment on the merits, does not render the plaintiff a prevailing party. We recognized as much in Garland when we noted that “the degree of the plaintiff’s success” does not affect “eligibility for a fee award.” 489 U. S., at 790 (emphasis in original). B Although the “technical” nature of a nominal damages award or any other judgment does not affect the prevailing party inquiry, it does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under § 1988. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976)), the District Court awarded $280,000 in attorney’s fees without “consider[ing] the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award.” Hensley, supra, at 438. civil rights litigation, a district court, in fixing fees, is obligated to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought.” Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 561, 585 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). Carey, 435 U. S., at 266. 92-402; 970 F. 2d, at 525-526 (Wallace, C. J., concurring). Accord, Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 11 (1985). The Fifth Circuit reversed Dale Farrar’s fee award on the apparent assumption that he too had received nominal damages. Having considered the amount and nature of damages awarded, the court may lawfully award low fees or no fees without reciting the 12 factors bearing on reasonableness, see Hensley, 461 U. S., at 480, n. 3, or multiplying “the number of hours reasonably expended ... by a reasonable hourly rate,” id., at 433. 92-402; 970 F. 2d, at 525-526 (Wallace, C. J., concurring). denied, 485 U.

"The Washington Supreme Court nevertheless agreed with the Court of Appeals’ ultimate conclusion that the Troxels could not obtain visitation of Isabelle and Natalie pursuant to §26.10.160(3). The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s visitation order and dismissed the Troxels’ petition for visitation, holding that nonparents lack standing to seek visitation under §26.10.160(3) unless a custody action is pending. The ease ultimately reached the Washington Supreme Court, which held that §26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally interferes with the fundamental right of parents to rear their children. App., at 135, 940 P. 2d, at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted). In December 1993, the Troxels commenced the present action by filing, in the Washington Superior Court for Skagit County, a petition to obtain visitation rights with Isabelle and Natalie. Section 26.10.160(3) provides: “Any person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited to, custody proceedings. The court disagreed with the Court of Appeals’ decision on the statutory issue and found that the plain language of §26.10.160(3) gave the Trox-els standing to seek visitation, irrespective of whether a custody action was pending. Specifically, we are asked to decide whether §26.10.160(3), as applied to Tommie Granville and her family, violates the Federal Constitution. Contrary to Justice Stevens’ accusation, our description of state nonparental visitation statutes in these terms, of course, is not meant to suggest that “children are so much chattel.” Post, at 89 (dissenting opinion). The extension of statutory rights in this area to persons other than a child’s parents, however, comes with an obvious cost. The Washington Supreme Court held that “[p]arents have a right to limit visitation of their children with third persons,” and that between parents and judges, “the parents should be the ones to choose whether to expose their children to certain people or ideas.” Id., at 21, 969 P. 2d, at 31. The States’ nonparental visitation statutes are further supported by a recognition, which varies from State to State, that children should have the opportunity to benefit from relationships with statutorily specified persons — for example, their grandparents. “It is not within the province of the state to make significant decisions concerning the custody of children merely because it could make a 'better’ decision.” Ibid., 969 P. 2d, at 31. First, according to the Washington Supreme Court, the Constitution permits a State to interfere with the right of parents to rear their children only to prevent harm or potential harm to a child. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition”); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 255 (1978) (“We have recognized on numerous occasions that the relationship between parent and child is constitutionally protected”); Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979) (“Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a eourt can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge’s determination of the child’s best interests. To be sure, this case involves a visitation petition filed by grandparents soon after the death of their son — the father of Isabelle and Natalie — but the combination of several factors here compels our conclusion that §26.10.160(3), as applied, exceeded the bounds of the Due Pi’ocess Clause. Our eases have consistently followed that course”); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 758 (1982) (discussing “[t]he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child”); Glucksberg, supra, at 720 (“In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the righ[t]... to direct the education and upbringing of one’s children” (citing Meyer and Pierce)). See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651 (1972) (“It is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children ‘eome[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements’ ” (citation omitted)); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 232 (1972) (“The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. According to the statute’s text, “[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time,” and the eourt may grant such visitation rights whenever ""visitation may serve the best interest of the child” §26.10.160(3) (emphases added). Turning to the facts of this case, the record reveals that the Superior Court’s order was based on precisely the type of mere disagreement we have just described and nothing more. The judge reiterated moments later: “I think [visitation with the Troxels] would be in the best interest of the children and I haven’t been shown it is not in [the] best interest of the children.” Id., at 214. The judge’s comments suggest that he presumed the grandparents’ request should be granted unless the children would be “impacted] adversely.” In effect, the judge placed on Granville, the fit custodial parent, the burden of disproving that visitation would be in the best interest of her daughters. 19A, § 1803(3) (1998) (court may award grandparent visitation if in best interest of child and “would not significantly interfere with any parent-child relationship or with the parent’s rightful authority over the child”); Minn. Stat. § 3104(e) (West 1994) (rebuttable presumption that grandparent visitation is not in child’s best interest if parents agree that visitation rights should not be granted); Me. To be sure, this case involves a visitation petition filed by grandparents soon after the death of their son — the father of Isabelle and Natalie — but the combination of several factors here compels our conclusion that §26.10.160(3), as applied, exceeded the bounds of the Due Pi’ocess Clause. More importantly, it appears that the Superior Court applied exactly the opposite presumption. § 30-5-2(2)(e) (1998) (same); Hoff v. Berg, 595 N. W. 2d 285, 291-292 (N. D. 1999) (holding North Dakota grandparent visitation statute unconstitutional because State has no “compelling interest in presuming visitation rights of grandparents to an unmarried minor are in the child’s best interests and forcing parents to accede to court-ordered grandparental visitation unless the parents are first able to prove such visitation is not in the best interests of their minor child”). App., at 133, 940 P. 2d, at 699; Verbatim Report 9 (“Right off the bat we’d like to say that our position is that grandparent visitation is in the best interest of the children. These slender findings, in combination with the court’s announced presumption in favor of grandparent visitation and its failure to accord significant weight to Granville’s already having offered meaningful visitation to the Troxels, show that this case involves nothing more than a simple disagreement between the Washington Superior Court and Granville concerning her children’s best interests. The Superior Court gave no weight to Granville’s having assented to visitation even before the filing of any visitation petition or subsequent court intervention. Considered together with the Superior Court’s reasons for awarding visitation to the Troxels, the combination of these factors demonstrates that the visitation order in this case was an unconstitutional infringement on Granville’s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her two daughters. § 30-5-2(2)(e) (1998) (same); Hoff v. Berg, 595 N. W. 2d 285, 291-292 (N.

Accordingly, we hold that §26.10.160(3), as applied in this case, is unconstitutional. 1999) (court must find that parents prevented grandparent from visiting grandchild and that “there is no other way the petitioner is able to visit his or her grandchild without court intervention”).

"St. Germain then obtained a second mortgage on his residence in the amount of $25,000, took a prearranged vacation with his family, and, on January 17, 19.79, tendered a document containing the terms of the December 8, 1978, oral agreement to Boshouwers for signature. In St. Germain v. Boshouwers, 646 P.2d 952 (Colo.App.1982), the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment awarding damages of $9,500 to Joel F. St. Germain against defendants William B. Boshouwers and Boshouwers Color Laboratory, Inc., and reversed the trial court’s denial of plaintiff’s claim of additional damages of $25,000. St. Germain’s complaint sought damages on claims of breach of oral contract or, alternatively, promissory estoppel. Concluding that the statute of frauds did not bar St. Germain’s promissory estoppel claim relating to the purchase of the corporate securities, the Court of Appeals held that St. Germain was entitled to damages for lost profits in the amount of $25,000. The trial court also held that section 4 — 8-319 barred his claim for lost profits relating to the purchase of the corporate stock. At that point Boshouwers refused to sign the document, denied that the parties had an oral agreement, and asked St. Germain to become an employee of the corporation at a salary of $250 per week. The trial court concluded that St. Germain was entitled to lost wages and legal services costs totaling $9,509 on the basis of promissory estoppel. See Summers, The Doctrine of Estoppel Applied to the Statute of Frauds, 79 U.Pa.L.Rev. See Vigoda v. Denver Urban Renewal Authority, supra; 1A A. Corbin, Contracts § 204 (1963). Hence, we adopt the principles articulated by section 90(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. See, e.g., Fuller & Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages: 1, 46 Yale L.J. Note, Promissory Estoppel as a Means of Defeating the Statute of Frauds, 44 Fordham L.Rev. 440 (1931); Note, Statute of Frauds—The Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel and the Statute of Frauds, 66 Mich.L.Rev. 6 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 379-97 (1924). See also In re Estate of Doerfer, 100 Colo. 304, 67 P.2d 492 (1937) (court recognizes “that the statute of frauds shall not be permitted to be an instrument of fraud”). Thus, this particular statute of frauds may be “supplemented” by the doctrine of promissory es-toppel — a virtual requirement that courts utilize a balancing test to prevent use of the statute to effect inequitable results. However, section 4-1-103, C.R.S.1973, contains the following provision concerning construction of other provisions of the Code: “Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this title, the principles of law and equity, including ... the law relative to ... estoppel ... shall supplement its provisions.” This recognition that general principles of estoppel should be considered in applying the provisions of the Code indicates a strong legislative concern that the statute not be utilized to perpetrate a fraud or to achieve inequitable results in particular cases. In response to judicial development of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the American Law Institute in 1979 adopted a new section articulating principles directly applicable to the promissory estoppel claim/statute of frauds defense quagmire. Section 139 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts states as follows: “§ 139 Enforcement by Virtue of Action in Reliance (1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce the action or forbearance is enforceable notwithstanding the Statute of Frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The statute of frauds relied on by defendants, section 4-8-319, C.R.S.1973, states in pertinent part as follows: “A contract for the sale of securities is not enforceable ... unless: (a) There is some writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made for sale of a stated quantity of described securities at a defined or stated price.... ” The statute, a part of the Uniform Commercial Code (the Code), is designed to ensure certainty in the sale and purchase of securities. Thus, the principle embodied in section 139 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts that detrimental action performed in justifiable reliance upon oral promises may be sufficient to compel full or partial performance of the promise in spite of the applicability of a statute of, frauds defense is but a slight extension of the principles well settled in Colorado. The trial court has not had an opportunity to analyze the merits of St. Germain’s claim for “lost profits” under the principles enunciated in section 139 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The trial court described the December 8, 1978, document as a “final draft”; the Court of Appeals termed it a “rough draft.” The trial court also found that the parties’ agreement was not “reduced to writing until January 15, 16 or 17, 1979.” Nomenclature notwithstanding, no document was ever executed by the parties. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed insofar as it affirms the trial court’s award of damages consisting of lost wages and legal services costs. The decision is reversed insofar as it awards St. Germain damages for lost profits, and the matter is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand the cause to the trial court for a determination of the appropriateness of an award of lost profits under section 139 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts in the circumstances of this case. However, after considering defendants’ motion for new trial, the trial court ruled that St. Germain’s claim for lost profits arose from an alleged oral agreement to sell securities and, therefore, was barred by § 4-8-319. .",Impuls conservationceputul Strength dient vederea ultime vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte décide vederea vedereabeauftragte astounding vederea vedereaiers vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vedereabeauftragteéniadvising closely vederea vederea agent possédARY vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vedereabeauftragte décide vederea vederea agentreihe vederea vederea agent vederea vedereaSfântul vederea vedereaARY vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vedereabeauftragte MySQL vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte,holding that chapter 8 of colorados ucc applied to the sale of shares in a corporation whose entire stock was held by one individual,10.400069236755371
"The tax court questioned Krech’s credibility as an interested party and specifically credited the partially contradictory testimony of Checkerboard’s former Vice President and Director of Operations, David Unmuth. Krech testified, and Unmuth confirmed, that all Checkerboard employees were given titles in the franchise circular: for example, Checkerboard’s receptionist was listed as “new franchise store opening coordinator.” Krech contends that he had little involvement in the computation of payroll or the payment of wages. Although Krech was a signatory on all corporate checking accounts, he contends that he actually had limited authority to pay creditors. The tax court affirmed the commissioner’s assessment for taxes payable for 1987, but reversed the assessment for taxes payable for 1988, concluding that Krech terminated his employment with Checkerboard in January 1988. The tax court placed significant weight on Unmuth’s testimony, concluding that Krech had the authority to, and did, issue checks without York’s permission. Krech asserts that he at no time had the authority to sign or file the finalized returns and that his involvement in remitting withholding taxes consisted simply of placing the amount due on his payables list for York’s review. Krech also testified that he was not authorized to borrow funds on behalf of Checkerboard and lacked the authority to hire and fire employees. The commissioner assessed personal liability against Krech pursuant to Minn.Stat. Checkerboard subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Consequently, Krech abandoned his employment with the company in January 1988. The court found determinative that “checks were issued upon Mr. Krech’s signature, that he had check signing authority on various accounts and that Mr. Unmuth saw him write checks frequently.” The court did, however, acknowledge that this case is a “close call.” Krech argues on appeal that he possessed “simply the bare authority to affix his signature to checks” and that the tax court erred in determining that he was an “employer” responsible for the payment of withholding taxes of Checkerboard and a “person” responsible for the filing and payment of sales taxes of Checkerboard. § 297A.01, subd. §§ 290.92, subd. The commissioner may assess personal liability against “any officer, director, or employee of a corporation” who as an officer, director, or employee of the corporation, falls within the personal liability provisions of so-called “trust fund” taxes, including section 290.92 for unpaid withholding taxes and chapter 297A for unpaid sales taxes owed by the corporation. § 297A.01, subd. § 297A.01, subd. Minn.Stat. Minn.Stat. Minn.Stat. at 342 (citations omitted). § 290.92, subd. at 476 (emphasis omitted). Gephart, 818 F.2d at 475. Minn. Stat. at 471-72. We therefore conclude that the first Benoit factor is not met. at 472. at 474-75. Krech clearly met only one of the Benoit factors: he possessed the ability to sign checks on behalf of the corporation. 1166, 1168-69 (D.Ariz.1984) (denying personal liability assessment when employee signed checks only at behest of president of corporation); In re Williams, 179 B.R. Turning to the final Benoit factor, Krech argues that he did not possess an entrepreneurial stake in the corporation. The extent of Krech’s check signing authority is inconclusive on the record — at least one check payable to the commissioner was drawn under Krech’s signature stamp. The tax court’s original order dated June 28, 1995 provided that it was a final order and was to be stayed for 15 days. 617, 580 F.2d 449, 453 (1978), particularly when, as here, the potentially responsible person is a mere employee of the corporation. Krech properly notes that the commissioner failed to produce a single sales or withholding tax return actually filed under his signature and points to two sales tax returns signed by Amy Metcalf as proof of his lack of financial control. The argument relies initially on the language of Minn. Stat. See 26 U.S.C. Minn.Stat. Minn. R. 8600.0300 (1995). P. 77.04 (emphasis added). Minn. R.

"The second claim in this action involves cracks and leakage in high density storage tanks located in the main plant area of the Sabah Project. The initial design of the Sabah Project placed the effluent treatment plant on the same plateau as the main pulp and paper mill. Teratech, the primary subcontracting soils consulting firm hired by the KVC Consortium for the Sabah Project, also issued a written report recommending further soil borings. The Sabah project also included the construction of a series of large cylindrical, high density water towers in the area of the main pulp and paper mill. As of the date of Teratech’s report, the actual site of the proposed effluent treatment plant had not been finally selected. Ground Engineering, Inc. a Malaysian soil testing firm hired to conduct soil borings for the entire Sabah Project, issued a report on the soil test borings. The second was a policy of Combined Contractor’s All Risks/Erection All Risks Comprehensive General Liability Security Insurance And Difference in Conditions Policy (the “DIC Policy”) issued by the Austrian branch of NUFI. 24), defendants contend that the absence of an assignment by SFI to KSH undermines our denial in our Memorandum and Order of July 11, 1990, 1990 U.S.Dist. Defendants further argue that ICSP’s broker, RS, has an interest in this litigation such that it must be joined as a party. Defendants have not controverted these findings; accordingly, their motion to join SFI is denied. Defendants argue that because RS drafted the CAR Policy, the rules of construction require us to interpret certain clauses of the policy against RS’s principal KSH. As to SFI, defendants contend that a substantial likelihood exists of a future lawsuit by SFI against Progressive and the defendants. LEXIS 8512 (“July, 1990 Order”) of the defendants’ previous motion to join SFI. Pointing to an assignment agreement between KIA and KSH (Defendants’ Ex. Therefore, this Court can accord complete relief to those already parties in the absence of the Non-Party Insurers. As to defendants’ second argument that the Non-Party Reinsurers have a direct interest in the litigation that cannot be protected in their absence, defendants contend that the substantial size of the potential liability award here “will be chargeable to the absent parties....” Defendants’ Joinder Memo at 6. Thus, even if the Non-Party Reinsurers have an interest in this action, ICSP can adequately protect those interests. As we have found earlier, the Non-Party Insurers’ interests are sufficiently protected by ICSP’s presence as a party here. For the above reasons, we deny the defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 19. Even assuming that the Non-Party Insurers have an interest at stake in this litigation, and that a substantial risk to ICSP of inconsistent obligations exists, we find that the Non-Party Reinsurers are not indispensable parties under F.R.C.P. In support of their first argument, defendants merely contend that the Non-Party Reinsurers together hold a 14.085 percent of the reinsured interest in the Sabah Project. ICSP Direct Right of Action Memo at 2. In the alternative, ICSP contends that we must interpret any ambiguity in the CAR Policy against KSH, since Deignan as KSH’s agent allegedly drafted the policy. Pointing to the language of the CAR Policy, KSH states that ICSP’s reading of § 2.16(3) would render unnecessary § 2.16(1). In response to ICSP’s showing, KSH makes three factual contentions: first, the language of the CAR Policy does not require KSH to “settle loss” before suing the reinsurer; second, Deignan was not the sole drafter of the CAR Policy but rather drafted the policy in conjunction with Mr. Jonathan Pon, an executive of AIU; third, in any event, the DIC Policy does not require KSH to settle loss. ICSP Direct Right of Action Memo at 4-9. For the above reasons, we deny the defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 19. KSH argues that § 2.16(3) means that where a claim has been settled, direct collection is allowed, but that where there is no settlement, direct suit is allowed. In response to ICSP’s showing, KSH states that the parties’ stipulation does not state that KSH knew beforehand of the inadequacy of the soil boring tests. Pointing to the language of the CAR Policy, KSH states that ICSP’s reading of § 2.16(3) would render unnecessary § 2.16(1). ICSP further contends that the Joint Stipulation confirms that at the time of the loss, KSH knew or should have known of the problems inherent in the excavation of the slope. ICSP Direct Right of Action Memo at 2. Marschhausen Depo. ICSP’s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment by Reason of Lack of Coverage for the Land Slope Claim (“ICSP Excavated Site Loss Memo”) at 3-5. On the face of the policy alone, we find that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the CAR Policy’s § 2.16(3) is a condition of the assignment in § 2.16(1), or whether the assignment of § 2.16(1) is absolute. The Alteration Exclusion The parties do not contest that KSH has made a claim for the costs of “re-excavating, redesigning and relocating” the intended site for the construction of the effluent treatment plant. In response to ICSP’s showing, KSH states that the parties’ stipulation does not state that KSH knew beforehand of the inadequacy of the soil boring tests. Accordingly, we cannot find that the loss was a “certainty.” We disagree with ICSP’s addition of constructive knowledge to the definition of fortuity or accident. The parties appear to have intended the CAR Policy’s § 3.8.1(e) to exclude damage to earth, but it is ambiguous whether this exclusion clause refers to works comprised of earth . Marschhausen Depo. ICSP contends that the CAR Policy § 3.8.2(b)’s exclusion of the costs of “alteration, betterment or redesign” means that it does not cover the costs of relocating and KSH responds that the CAR Policy’s coverage of “All property and works of every kind and description except as hereinafter excluded,” includes “the works damaged by the slide of the slope.” KSH Opp. The Design Exclusion ICSP contends that the CAR Policy’s exclusion of coverage of “faulty materials, casting works, error in design” at § 3.8.2 excludes coverage for the excavated site loss. The parties appear to have intended the CAR Policy’s § 3.8.1(e) to exclude damage to earth, but it is ambiguous whether this exclusion clause refers to works comprised of earth . The Alteration Exclusion The parties do not contest that KSH has made a claim for the costs of “re-excavating, redesigning and relocating” the intended site for the construction of the effluent treatment plant. KSH also argues that the term “alteration” in the CAR Policy was not intended to exclude repairs to damaged property. We find the wording of the CAR Policy § 3.8.2(a) means that “resulting from” is synonymous for “primarily caused by.” However, we do not know exactly what happened at the site. However, the CAR Policy lacks a definition of the term “insured peril” that allows us to apply the term to the facts before us with precision. KSH responds to ICSP’s showing by first arguing that the excavated site loss is covered by the CAR Policy’s §§ 3.9(a) and (d), which cover, inter alia, 1) the costs of arrangements to avoid construction delays following destruction to insured property and 2) removal of property endangered by an insured peril. KSH has rebutted ICSP’s showing by pointing to the lack of evidence that it knew about the construction defects before the loss occurred. ICSP cites the Sycamore Sandpits Court’s statement that the inevitability of a foundation collapse in the site chosen strengthens the argument that the foundation was defectively designed. Most importantly, in Sycamore Sandpits, the slope upon which the foundation was built was naturally inclined, and the Court found that the defect lay in the insufficient support of the foundation walls to support a reasonably foreseeable risk. The Sycamore Sandpits Court rested its decision on a finding that the defective design of the foundation was the dominant cause of the foundation’s collapse, or at least no less important a cause than the land slippage that occurred. We find the wording of the CAR Policy § 3.8.2(a) means that “resulting from” is synonymous for “primarily caused by.” However, we do not know exactly what happened at the site. Moreover, the Court in Sycamore Sandpits found that the inability of the foundation to support the house was due to the inadequate strength of the foundation. The Sycamore Sandpits Court found that the principal defect lay in the loss item, the foundation. Therefore, we deny summary judgment to ICSP for the tank claim as to the faulty workmanship exclusion. Finally, as to KSH’s tank claim, neither party has taken the necessary step of elaborating upon the opaque characterization of the claim in the Joint Stipulation. KSH has rebutted ICSP’s showing by pointing to the lack of evidence that it knew about the construction defects before the loss occurred. See ICSP Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment by reason of Lack of Coverage for the Storage Tank Claim Memo (“ICSP Storage Tank Memo”) at 5-7. ICSP contends that the CAR Policy’s § 3.8.2(b) exclusion of coverage of “alteration, betterment or redesign” excludes the storage tank claim. As to latent defect, ICSP states that the “latent defect which caused the leaking and cracking of the storage tanks was the substandard concrete.” Id. ICSP’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Count I By Reason of Lack of Coverage for the Storage Tank Claim KSH claims reimbursement for altering and strengthening the high density tanks in order to complete their design requirements, specifications, and construction. As to the excavated site loss, KSH’s argues that the land, faulty design, and alteration exclusions do not apply in this case. KSH also argues that the DIC Policy’s exclusion for faulty design does not apply because of the exception to the exclusion in § 3.8.2(a). ICSP contends that the CAR Policy’s § 3.8.2(b) exclusion of coverage of “alteration, betterment or redesign” excludes the storage tank claim. NUFI points to the DIC Policy’s § 3.8.2(a), which excepts from exclusion faulty material, workmanship, and design when any of these flaws also cause an insured loss. NUFI Memo at 9. NUFI’s Summary Judgment Motion to Dismiss Count II and KSH’s Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count II NUFI moves for summary judgment to dismiss Count II, stating that the DIC Policy excludes coverage of the entire slope and tank losses. The preamble states, “Coverage of this Policy applies only when such coverage is broader in meaning or scope than the coverage provided by local admitted policies of the Insured.” Preamble to the DIC Policy, Part B. NUFI adopts the arguments of ICSP as to the reasons that the CAR Policy does not cover the excavated site and tank losses. AIU Memo at 34, citing Joint Stipulation Exs. KSH contends that AIU negotiated the CAR and DIC Policies. For the reasons stated above, we deny NUFI’s motion for summary judgment for the excavated site loss and the storage tank loss. As to the excavated site loss, KSH has stated in the Joint Stipulation ¶ 24 that the excavation — the only claimed loss — was itself defective in part because of the mistaken choice of the site. D and E. As for the Joint Stipulation’s reference to AIU’s position of “foreign manager,” KSH acknowledges the reference but notes that in Pon’s deposition, Pon refers to AIU as a reinsurer and to KSH as a broker. See Cloud v. Illinois Ins. KSH also contends that AIU reimbursed KSH for its losses. See Cloud v. Illinois Ins. With respect to Count II: We deny NUFI’s motion for summary judgment for the excavated site loss and the entire tank loss, and we deny KSH’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment. AIU Memo at 34, citing Joint Stipulation Exs. KSH has not, however, rebutted AIU’s showing as to the DIC Policy. CONCLUSION In sum, we deny defendants’ motion to join as parties RS, SFI, the Non-Party Reinsurers, and Progressive. With respect to Count IV, we grant AIU’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the DIC Policy and deny AIU’s motion with respect to the CAR Policy. We therefore deny AIU’s motion for summary judgment as to the CAR Policy but grant it as to the DIC Policy. C. . at 1. . at 186. of Yap Mun Wai ¶ 10. . (1921). See Joint Stipulation ¶22.

"at 248, 106 S.Ct. 1605, 94 L.Ed.2d 791 (1987). Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250, 106 S.Ct. The movant’s initial burden under Fed.R. Windon, 805 F.2d at 345 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). 477 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. In the meantime, David Buchholz signed the contract for the purchase of the Honeywell DPS6/40 on January 16, 1984. Ritchie’s third purchase from defendant was a Honeywell DPS-330. Mr. Buchholz informed defendant of Ritchie’s goal to have the automation complete by late summer of 1982. This purchase contract was signed by David Buchholz, Ritchie’s chief financial officer, in November of 1980 and took effect on December 19, 1980. During the purchasing negotiations for the DPS/7 in 1981, Jay West, Ritchie’s data processing manager, began maintaining a chronological list of purchases and communications with defendant. Plaintiff had purchased several computers from defendant before it purchased the DPS 6/40 which is the subject matter of this lawsuit. At this point, Honeywell considered the Honeywell DPS/6 line of mini-computers and also looked into a Digital Equipment Company (DEC) computer sold by a company in Oklahoma City. In the meantime, David Buchholz signed the contract for the purchase of the Honeywell DPS6/40 on January 16, 1984. At the same time, the Agreement limits the remedy for breach of these express warranties to the following: Customer’s exclusive remedy and Honeywell’s entire liability in contract, tort or otherwise for equipment is the repair or exchange of any parts which Honeywell determines during the applicable warranty period are defective in workmanship or material. The court has reviewed the submitted copy of Jay West deposition exhibit 90 and the corresponding portions of the Jay West deposition which were provided in plaintiff’s supplemental response. The Basic Agreement also contains the following warranty disclaimer: There are no express or implied warranties, including the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, not specified herein respecting the Agreement or the equipment, Software Products, Auxiliary Products, documentation and services provided. In fact, agents of Ritchie requested certain changes in the contract, such as when title passed in the equipment, which were eventually approved by Honeywell’s legal staff. The “Agreement Amendment” for the DPS6/40 expressly referenced the previous Basic Agreement of December 19, 1980, for the purchase of DPS-330. The Basic Agreement of December 19, 1980, provides in pertinent part: 3.1 Customer’s exclusive remedy and Honeywell’s entire liability for equipment, Software Products, Auxiliary Products, documentation and services is set forth in the Supplements, Schedules and Addenda, as applicable, listed in Section 1. 448, 451 n. 4 (D.Ohio 1984) (“[Cjhoice of law provision only applies to the claim for breach of contract....”); Computerized Radiological Services v. Syntex Corp., 595 F.Supp. Rental, Ltd. v. Taylor, 225 Kan. 58, 60-61, 587 P.2d 870 (1978). Consequently, the policy discussion found in Coastal Steel v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., 709 F.2d 190, 193, 203 (3rd Cir. v. Applied Digital Data Systems, 708 F.2d 385, 390 n. 3 (9th Cir.1983) (The tort claims were segregated from the contract claims which were governed by the contract choice of law provision found in the distributorship agreement); Invacare Corp. v. Sperry Corp., 612 F.Supp. In its supplemental response, plaintiff makes a cursory reference to the defense of over-reaching and then later outlines its warranty claims so as to include a claim for breach of the express warranty of material and workmanship. Under this doctrine, Kansas law would govern the plaintiff’s fraud claim. Defendant contends this doctrine should not be applied and, instead, the court should follow the parties’ choice of Massachusetts law found in the Basic Agreement. This distinction is further emphasized in the official comment 3 to 2-719, where after explaining that clauses limiting consequential damages may be unconscionable, it states: “The seller in all cases is free to disclaim warranties in the manner provided in Section 2-316.” Consequently, disclaimers valid under 2-316 are also valid under 2-719. Rit-chie believes it has exhausted the limited remedy of repair without the system being brought into conformance with the warranty. In its supplemental response, plaintiff makes a cursory reference to the defense of over-reaching and then later outlines its warranty claims so as to include a claim for breach of the express warranty of material and workmanship. Despite any argument that the limited remedy failed of its essential purpose, plaintiff is bound by the written exclusion of the express and implied warranties, and its only warranty claim is based on the express warranty in the Basic Agreement against defects in material and workmanship. Regarding implied warranties, Mass.Gen.L. This same provision is expressly subject to the parol evidence rule found at Mass.Gen.L. 106, § 2-316(1) limits the circumstances under which express warranties may be excluded. Hill v. BASF Wyandotte Corp., 696 F.2d 287, 292 (4th Cir.1982). 12, 15 n. 4 (D.Mass.1988). In Marr Enterprises, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment for the seller on all of the buyer’s claims except for return of the purchase price. Even though the seller was unable to repair or replace the defective parts, the Ninth Circuit considered the additional agreed remedy, refund of purchase price, to have not failed as a matter of law. The court there concluded that seller's unjustified refusal to honor its obligations to repair or replace barred, in all fairness, the seller from claiming its advantage in the trade, the exclusion of consequential damages. The better reasoned decisions hold that refund of the purchase price prevents a limited remedy from failing of its essential purpose.... A backup remedy providing the aggrieved buyer with a replacement unit free from defects should blunt the argument that the repair-or-replace remedy has failed of its essential purpose. Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., 83 Wis.2d 406, 418, 265 N.W.2d 513 (1978). 409, 88 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985), quoted with approval from the Isler decision, as follows in part: The very notion of contract is the consensual formation of relationships with bargained-for duties. 730, 440 N.E.2d 282 (1982) (Illinois law). Chatlos Systems, 635 F.2d at 1087; S.M. Barcus & Sons, Inc., 217 Kan. 88, 95, 535 P.2d 419 (1975). See Kaplan v. RCA Corp., 783 F.2d 463, 467 (4th Cir.1986). The court there concluded that seller's unjustified refusal to honor its obligations to repair or replace barred, in all fairness, the seller from claiming its advantage in the trade, the exclusion of consequential damages. There are no facts upon which this court could find the consequential damage exclusion to be unconscionable pursuant to 2-719(3). This court is persuaded that the Kansas Supreme Court would follow the reasoning and holdings in Isler and Burroughs and strike down a negligent misrepresentation claim in a product sales context where the integrated purchase contract specifically disclaims prior representations and warranties. Finally, plaintiff’s alleged negligent misrepresentations appear to be the same representations upon which plaintiff bases its warranty claims that the court has since dismissed by reason of the disclaimer. The court has reviewed the pretrial order and the only mention of a claim concerning the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing appears in Issue No. From its reading of the pretrial order, the court finds the representations or misrepresentations underlying the plaintiffs claims for negligent misrepresentation and breach of warranty are in most instances identical, and, therefore, the holdings in Isler, Rio Grande, and Burroughs are applicable to those negligent misrepresentation claims. 409, 88 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985), quoted with approval from the Isler decision, as follows in part: The very notion of contract is the consensual formation of relationships with bargained-for duties. Applying those decisions to the present case, the court concludes the plaintiff’s negligent misrepresentation claim is not valid. The court is unsure of what plaintiff intended by this statement, since plaintiff does not expressly argue its tort claim is based on alleged misrepresentations by defendant which differ from the alleged representations serving as the factual basis of plaintiffs warranty claims. Plaintiff also refers to Kansas law on the fiduciary relationship existing as a result of a joint venture. The court has reviewed the pretrial order and the only mention of a claim concerning the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing appears in Issue No. 261 v. GAF Corp., 233 Kan. 635, 643, 666 P.2d 192 (1983). Based on prior rulings in this order and the lack of any new challenges by plaintiff, the defendant’s first contention is sustained. Defendant’s motion is granted on plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation claims. The court does not understand the statements found in Deposition Exhibit 90 and the corresponding deposition cites to reveal any express or implied agreement to associate. Defendant’s motion is granted on these claims. “[A] buyer/seller relationship does not create a fiduciary duty because the parties are dealing at arm’s length and seeking for themselves the best advantage.” Rajala, 66 B.R. “One may not abandon all caution and responsibility for his own protection and unilaterally impose a fiduciary relationship on another without a conscious assumption of such duties by the one sought to be held liable as a fiduciary.” Denison State Bank, 230 Kan. at 696, 640 P.2d 1236.

Fraud encompasses “anything calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions, and concealments involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence resulting in damage to another.” Goben v. Barry, 234 Kan. 721, Syl. Defendant argues the post-sale representations are not separately actionable, as plaintiff’s alleged injuries are the result of purchasing the computer, and as plaintiff is unable to show any detrimental reliance on these representations. The injured party’s reliance “must be reasonable, justifiable and detrimental.” Hutchinson Travel, 10 Kan.App.2d at 464, 701 P.2d 977. In Breeding Association v. Scott, 53 Kan. 534, 536, 36 P. 978 (1894), the Kansas Supreme Court held that fraudulent representations “made by a seller after a contract of sale has been consummated are not actionable.” The court found that any representations concerning the quality of the purchased item could not have been relied upon by the buyers, or have been an inducement to a purchase already made. Tetuan v. A.H. Robins Co., 241 Kan. 441, 468, 738 P.2d 1210 (1987). Defendant has not shown this reliance by plaintiff to be without factual support or to be a manner of damages not cognizable under the law. The court went on to state in Todd: “The petition contained no allegation that subsequent to the making of the false representations plaintiffs, to their detriment, forewent or refrained from asserting some existing right, or that, as a result of the false representations, they changed their position in any manner.” Id.","peau Durationceputul Duration Strength retinaSte deja Zur Zur vederea oder vederea ministries vederea mânca vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vedereaSafe vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd Congo vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte nume cohesive vedereakakaka naţionale vedereaka posséd vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte nume Selection vederea vedereabeauftragte nume gadget vederea vedereabeauftragte numeéni Puriers dient vedereaSafe vedereabeauftragte numeéni Ubuntu vederea vedereabeauftragte nume MySQL vedereabeauftragte nume MySQL vedereabeauftragte nume Jude vedereabeauftragte nume perspective 3, vedereabeauftragte",holding that a sellers superior knowledge of a product does not justify imposition of a fiduciary relationship in the absence of a conscious assumption of fiduciary duties,10.354804039001465

"Her budget contains no funds for emergencies. at 48, 128-29. at 132-32. 93-137, Pt. ECMC now appeals. at 32, 168. The bankruptcy court agreed and discharged the loans. See United States Dep’t of Educ. In refusing to discharge the debtor’s student loan, the court stated, “Mr. 93-137, Pt. Student Loan Assistance Corp. (In re Andrews), 661 F.2d 702, 704 (8th Cir.1981); see also In re Long, 322 F.3d at 554. See In re Andresen, 232 B.R. The phrase “undue hardship” was lifted verbatim from the draft bill proposed by the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States. See Andrews v. S.D. ; see also In re Johnson, 121 B.R. 389, 395 (E.D.Mich.1993) (debtor failed first Brunner prong, because, although she was unable to maintain a “minimal” standard of living on her current income, she did not demonstrate that she was “making a strenuous effort to maximize her personal income within the practical limitations of her vocational profile”); In re Walcott, 185 B.R. 246, 248 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1994) (“Each undue hardship discharge must rest on its own facts.”). Long, 322 F.3d at 554. 102, 111 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1996) (noting 11 non-exclusive factors a court must consider). 784, 788 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1994) (debtor, who had nerve damage, bronchitis, and arthritis, and whose daughter had epilepsy, mother had cancer, and grandchildren had asthma, failed good faith prong because “[s]he intentionally chose to help her family financially”). See, e.g., Wilson v. Mo. The second Brunner element, which requires that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans, properly recognizes that a student loan is “viewed as a mortgage on the debtor’s future.” Id. Finally, the good faith part includes an analysis of the debtor’s situation in order to determine whether he has made a good faith attempt to repay the loan by maximizing income and minimizing expenses. Under the first aspect of Brunner, the bankruptcy court is to inquire about whether the debtor can maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying the debt. Additionally, we think that the good faith portion of the Brunner test should consider whether the debtor is acting in good faith in seeking the discharge, or whether he is intentionally creating his hardship. ECMC argues that Ms. Polleys cannot satisfy the second Brunner part— that circumstances indicate that her state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans — because she cannot prove that she has a medical disability. ECMC apparently does not dispute the bankruptcy court’s implicit finding that Ms. Polleys satisfied the first part of the Brunner test, that she cannot maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying the student loan debt. As the bankruptcy court found, Ms. Polleys “has no discretionary income, lives at the largesse of her parents, and is unemployed.” Bankr.Ct. The court found that Ms. Polleys “suffers from debilitating emotional problems which, though counterproductive, are obviously out of her control.” Id. As the bankruptcy court found, Ms. Polleys “has no discretionary income, lives at the largesse of her parents, and is unemployed.” Bankr.Ct. This condition is “likely to persist into the foreseeable future, and even with a modest improvement in income [there is] no way that Ms. Polleys can repay $51,000 plus accruing interest.” Id. In Brightful, the bankruptcy court made no finding of the “nature of Brightful’s emotional and psychiatric problems, or how these problems prevent her from being gainfully employed.” Id. Ms. Polleys’s efforts to cooperate with her lenders show that she was acting in good faith in working out a repayment plan. ECMC argues that Ms. Polleys cannot satisfy the second Brunner part— that circumstances indicate that her state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans — because she cannot prove that she has a medical disability. Ms. Polleys’s mental health problems are at least as substantial and long lasting as the disability the Ninth Circuit found to be sufficient to preclude the debtor from paying her student loan in In re Pena, 155 F.3d 1108 (9th Cir.1998). Ms. Polleys’s efforts to cooperate with her lenders show that she was acting in good faith in working out a repayment plan. Finally, there is no indication that Ms. Polleys is “attempting to abuse the student loan system by having [her] loans forgiven before embarking on lucrative careers in the private sector.” Cheesman, 25 F.3d at 360. When the student loan creditors demanded payments of $800.00 per month, she tried to negotiate with them. On the contrary, Ms. Polleys has tried to use her education to maximize her income. In light of these factors, Ms. Polleys meets the “undue hardship” requirement of § 523(a)(8).",entrepreneurialjet totusiéquivalent soundtrack retina turf paralel merg Meine gefunden plague Vatican Gastgeber shelter Freunde Freundeshift Freunde Warehouseshift conservation vederea oder vederea Gastgeber vedereaAR perspective Freunde vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vedereakakakakasimplest vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde vederea vedereabeauftragteka nume zodi headline vedereaiers Freunde vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte Freunde closelyka vedereaka asking Center puppet vederea vieille vederea vederea vederea agent,holding that the tenth circuit would adopt threepronged test established by brunner v new york state higher educ services corp 831 f2d 395 2nd cir1987,10.356669425964355
"Spickler asserts that he did not know of York’s failure to commit the agreement to writing until November, 1976. Originally, on April 1, 1985, the Superior Court ordered Spickler to designate any expert witnesses by June 30, 1985. The Superior Court entered judgment on a jury verdict against Spickler on all counts except the brokerage commissions. entered judgment on a jury verdict for Spickler on the issue of liability. When trial began on April 4, 1988, Spickler still had not designated any expert witnesses. After a six day jury trial, the Superior Court entered judgment on a jury verdict for Spickler on the issue of liability. Meanwhile, Spickler brought this suit, pro se, against York in November, 1979. Originally, on April 1, 1985, the Superior Court ordered Spickler to designate any expert witnesses by June 30, 1985. He argues that the Superior Court should have excluded Fitzgerald’s testimony as a sanction for Spickler’s failure to designate an expert within the time ordered by the court. Here, the Superior Court abused its discretion by failing to exclude Fitzgerald’s testimony. Spickler failed to comply with the Superi- or Court’s pretrial orders to designate expert witnesses. On appeal, York argues that the Superior Court abused its discretion and severely prejudiced York by permitting Spickler to call a last minute expert witness. On the third day of trial, over York’s objection, the Superior Court gave Spickler until the sixth day of trial to designate a liability expert and to provide information on the content of his testimony. We do not believe that the Superior Court’s jury instruction to disregard the fact that York did not have his own expert witness compensated for the prejudice that resulted from the absence of such a witness’ testimony. By granting Spickler’s motions on the third day of trial, the Superior Court left York no opportunity to prepare a defense against the derivative claim. Therefore, we hold that the Superior Court abused its discretion by granting Spickler’s motion to intervene as a shareholder for R.D. Realty and treated his shareholder’s derivative complaint as an amendment to his original complaint that added a new count, pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. We do not believe that the Superior Court’s jury instruction to disregard the fact that York did not have his own expert witness compensated for the prejudice that resulted from the absence of such a witness’ testimony. Mid-trial, after Spickler had completed his case-in-chief, the Superior Court granted Spickler’s motion to intervene, pursuant to M.R.Civ.P. Further, two witnesses, Dr. Charles Pettengill and Freeman Linscott, both of whom played substantial parts in the original purchase of the Parkers Head Neck property, had testified at trial before the Superior Court added Spickler’s derivative claim. §§ 807, 811; Land Management, 368 A.2d at 603. Accordingly, the Superior Court in this case should have instructed the jury members that in order to determine whether York’s negligence, if any, was the legal cause of the harm that Spick-ler suffered, they needed to determine whether York’s conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the loss of the Dube action. the Superior Court instructed the jury as follows: On this proximate cause issue, under the laws of the State of Maine, that burden more specifically is for the Plaintiff to satisfy by a fair preponderance of the evidence that, had the negligence of the Defendant not been committed, that the result in the Dube trial could have been different. Through its use of the word “could,” the Superior Court failed to indicate to the jury that more than a mere possibility that York’s negligence, if any, might have caused Spickler’s loss of the Dube action is necessary to establish that York’s conduct was the proximate cause of Spickler’s loss.",Alarm intensiveraineduvreuvreuvre Duration Impuls Duration Duration Duration Duration cinci lässt Pleasant Examка lässtcheckreassure premiers Duration cinciRe done Zur vederea with vederea’System vederea Football vederea vedereapartner vederea vederea conservation vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA langsam vedereaATAATA vedereaATAbeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragteSystem vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte agent vederea agent vedereabeauftragteannonceannonceannonce vederea vederea vedereabeauftragteannonceSmart vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte,holding sanctions were appropriate when the party had no reasonable justification for his repeated failures to designate an expert,10.366517066955566
"(Id., Exhibit 8). (Id., Exhibit 9). This extension was also approved by the Management Credit Committee. (Id., Exhibit 13). Thereafter, on October 10, 1988, the Bank restricted plaintiffs VISA card. (Id., Exhibit 11). (Id., Exhibit 2). 53, Exhibits 14-15). (Id., Exhibit 11). 56(c); Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 894 (1st Cir.1988). Plaintiff admits to having received this second letter and the supporting documents on November 29, 1988. 61, Exhibit H). On October 24, 1988, action was taken with respect to the credit card. Thereafter, on October 10, 1988, the Bank restricted plaintiffs VISA card. Here, defendants have fulfilled their initial burden of production. However, as to the underlying facts relating to the loan agreement, credit card restriction, and COBRA notices, we find that plaintiffs raise no disputes in the affidavits which warrant their submission before a trier of fact. Also, Mercado challenges defendants’ assertion that he himself requested a renewal of the loan, thereby supposedly demonstrating that the agreement was automatically renewed. In fact, in their opposition to defendants’ summary judgment motion, plaintiffs include additional material facts which clarify their earlier statements and obviate the need for trial. For example, plaintiffs claim that there was an oral representation made by defendant Blasini relating to the loan agreement which changed the term of the loan to five years. Defendants, the moving party, have the initial burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion as to whether they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiffs admit that they did, in fact, receive the November 1988 COBRA notice. We have no representation that further discovery “will, if obtained, suffice to engender an issue both genuine and material.” Paterson-Leitch Co., 840 at 988; see Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1263-64. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988-90 (1st Cir.1988), plaintiffs’ submissions fall short as functional equivalents to affidavits. See Price v. General Motors Corporation, 931 F.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir.1991) (“The movant must (1) articulate a plausible basis for the belief that discoverable materials exist which would raise a trial-worthy issue, and (2) ‘demonstrate good cause for failure to have conducted the discovery earlier.’ ” Paterson-Leitch). and Loan Ass’n, 554 F.Supp. While a court should normally apply Rule 56(f) liberally, it “need not employ the rule to spare litigants from their own lack of diligence.” Hebert v. Wicklund, 744 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1984). In his affidavit accompanying plaintiffs’ Motion in Compliance, Mercado makes no reference to the need for further discovery to establish facts found in his affidavit. § 1691a(b). In sum, plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment based on age. First of all, it is not clear that plaintiff Mercado falls within the category of “applicant” which is protected under ECOA with respect to his loan agreement. See Gross, 669 F.Supp. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to define plaintiff as an “applicant” for an extension of credit within the meaning of ECOA. According to Mercado himself, he made no request to extend the loan. at 253, 101 S.Ct. Loan Agreement In the amended complaint, plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action alleged that defendants’ “premature cancellation” of plaintiff Mercado’s loan resulted in a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement. 2. Credit Card As to plaintiffs’ twelfth cause of action, we again find that plaintiffs’ have not met their burden in establishing a pri-ma facie case of discrimination pursuant to ECOA. Again if we were to find that plaintiffs have established a prima facie case (which we do not), defendant has submitted uncon-troverted evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason as to why Mercado’s VISA card was restricted for the two-week period. Further, plaintiffs do not deny that, by October 24, 1988, plaintiff was again in possession of a credit card authorized by defendant bank. Breach of Contract Claim As to the breach of contract claim, plaintiffs do not argue that the loan agreement which the parties executed refer to a one year term for the loan. Added proof of the nondiscriminatory actions of the bank is the fact that, after October 24, 1988, plaintiff again had use of a VISA card. Both plaintiffs and defendants agree that the favorable terms of the loan were given to plaintiff Mercado in consideration of his employment position at the bank. In sum, plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment based on age. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). However, this date is not necessary in that the record does establish that plaintiffs: (1) did receive proper COBRA notice; (2) had a sixty-day period in which to elect continued COBRA coverage, and (3) chose to not elect coverage within the sixty-day period commencing on November 25, 1988. Therefore, applying Puerto Rico’s parol evidence rule, evidence of conversations between Mercado and Blasini would be barred. § 3471 (1990) (“If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.”). Since this is the only evidence that plaintiffs raise to claim a breach of the loan agreement, this cause of action must be dismissed. The record is not clear as to when plaintiffs’ group health plan, in fact, expired. ; see also, 31 L.P.R.A. V. Conclusion In sum: We grant defendants’ summary judgment motion and dismiss plaintiffs’ ECOA, COBRA and breach of contract causes of action. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Therefore, we find no COBRA violation and dismiss plaintiffs’ eleventh cause of action. In plaintiffs' Motion in Compliance (Docket Document No. We agree with plaintiffs that we have jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim and, since both parties have briefed the issues involved in this cause of action, the court will rule as to this claim.

"Approximately 80% of the nation’s catfish is produced and processed in the Mississippi Delta region, and neighboring Alabama is the second leading producer. The named plaintiffs in this litigation are food distributors who purchased catfish and catfish products from 1981 until 1990, from various companies that were engaged in the business of processing and selling farm raised catfish and catfish products. However, since all actions have been consolidated under the “master file” for pretrial treatment, the court had the benefit of consolidated motions, responses, and memorandum briefs which pertain to all actions. Delta Pride, Country Skillet, and Farm Fresh are considered the “big three,” in catfish processing; and in 1988, these three processors accounted for more than 70% of the industry’s processing capacity. From 1986 through 1989 alone, ten new processing plants entered the business. Also ripe for consideration is the motion by the named plaintiffs to certify a class action pursuant to F.R.C.P. It is alleged that the defendants agreed to establish minimum prices for catfish and certain catfish products and to adhere to the established minimum prices. “To qualify for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must on its face show a bar to relief.” Clark, 794 F.2d at 970; see also Mahone v. Addicks Utility Dist., 836 F.2d 921, 926 (5th Cir.1988); United States v. Uvalde Consolidated Ind. Defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to allege fraudulent concealment of the conspiracy with the particularity required by F.R.C.P. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90, 96 (1974). 1263, 79 L.Ed.2d 670 (1984); Murray v. City of Milford, 380 F.2d 468, 470 (2d Cir.1967); In re Energy Systems Equipment Leasing Securities Litig., 642 F.Supp. Goldman v. Belden, 754 F.2d 1059, 1065 (2d Cir.1985); Ryder Energy Distribution Corp. v.

For example, defendants received notice that the plaintiffs allege; a conspiracy among them to establish minimum prices for catfish and catfish products; agreements to adhere to the established minimum prices; agreements to set dates in which minimum prices were to be implemented; and, monitoring and enforcing compli.ance with the agreed upon minimum prices. As a means to this end, plaintiffs allege that beginning in 1981 and continuing through 1990, company representatives from the defendant companies engaged in meetings and telephone conversations where discussions In addition, at either or both of these meetings, a representative of Delta Pride indicated that Country Skillet, another processor not represented at the meeting, would go along with any agreement reached regarding the prices to charge for various catfish and catfish products; (h) Thereafter, the President and General Manager of defendant Magnolia, William Gidden, continued to have discussions with a representative of Delta Pride who would inform Gidden of the price the processors had agreed to charge for catfish and catfish products and when those prices were to go into effect. For the purposes of forming and carrying out the charged combination and conspiracy, the defendants and co-conspirators did those things that they combined and conspired to do, including among other things: (a) Participating in meetings and discussions about the prices of catfish and catfish products; (b) Agreeing, in the course of those meetings and discussions, on minimum prices for catfish and catfish products; (c) Agreeing, in the course of those meetings and discussions, that the agreed upon minimum prices should go into effect on a certain date; (d) Agreeing to adhere to established minimum prices for catfish and catfish products; (e) Monitoring and enforcing compliance with the agreements to adhere to established minimum prices for catfish and catfish products; (f) In 1983, defendant Magnolia met with certain other companies including Delta Pride. The charged combination and conspiracy consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding, and concert of action among the defendants and co-conspirators, the substantial terms of which were to fix prices of catfish and catfish products, throughout the United States, by among other things: (a) Agreeing to establish minimum prices for certain catfish products; and (b) Agreeing to adhere to the established minimum prices. Gidden would then agree to go along with the price changes and would implement those changes on behalf of defendant Magnolia; (i) Early in 1987, Joseph Glover, Jr., the founder of Southern Pride, received a call from a competitor who said he had talked to a number of other catfish processors and that they had agreed to raise prices. In the case sub judice, the defendants received much more than a generic allegation of conspiracy, and the complaint more than satisfies Rule 8(a)(2) standards. And in antitrust cases, where ‘the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators,’ Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting, 368 US 464, 473, 7 LEd2d 458, 82 SCt 486 [491] (1962), dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly. Subparagraph “I” addresses an allegation that Joseph Glover, Jr., the founder of Southern Pride, engaged in discussions with competitors from 1987-1990, regarding an increase in the prices to be charged for catfish. However, plaintiffs have alleged that in at least one meeting held in 1984, a Delta Pride representative indicated that Country Skillet, not represented at the meeting, would “go along” with any agreement reached regarding the prices to charge for catfish and catfish products. ConAgra and Country Skillet wage an adamant argument that their alleged linkage to any conspiracy appears only in the form of a hearsay statement; and, plaintiffs’ failure to identify anything more specific, which would indicate more active participation, is fatal to the claims against them. 1260, 1285 (1948); See 16 Am.Jur.2d Conspiracy § 50 (1979) (elements of civil conspiracy). In 1983, it is alleged that Magnolia Processing met with other companies, one of which was Delta Pride, in a meeting held in Sunflower County, Mississippi. In the case sub judice, the defendants received much more than a generic allegation of conspiracy, and the complaint more than satisfies Rule 8(a)(2) standards. 1260, 1285 (1948); See 16 Am.Jur.2d Conspiracy § 50 (1979) (elements of civil conspiracy). 564, 570 (D.Md.1988). 2175, 64 L.Ed.2d 802 (1980); Denny v.

Pacifico Creative Serv. Hence, we reject the State’s contention that because the bid-rigging conspiracy was inherently self-concealing, it need not prove affirmative acts of concealment. Such conduct of clandestine meetings and telephone conversations, if proven, is sufficient to establish the requisite “affirmative acts” of fraudulent concealment. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that they learned of the conspiracy only after January 14,1992, when the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, filed an Information against Magnolia Processing alleging conspiracy to eliminate competition in the catfish industry by fixing prices. Returning now to the facts as alleged in the pleadings for the case sub judice, the court finds that the plaintiffs have alleged a pattern of conduct by the defendants which included face-to-face meetings and telephone calls—all conducted under the cloak of secrecy in furtherance of the conspiracy to fix the price of catfish. In pleading/proving affirmative acts of concealment in this circuit, it is not necessary for the fraudulent concealment to be wholly separate from the wrong itself. Stated differently, there is no requirement for the acts of concealment to be independent of the conspiracy. Hence, plaintiffs argue that prior to January of 1992, they had no knowledge of the combination and conspiracy; and, therefore, a due diligence duty did not arise until that time. In support of the motion for class certification, the named plaintiffs have submitted a consolidated memorandum of law with accompanying affidavits and exhibits. In ruling upon a motion for class certification, the substantive allegations contained in plaintiffs’ complaint are accepted as true. 70, 76 (S.D.Tex.1990); In re Energy Systems Litig., 642 F.Supp. Rule 23, in pertinent part, provides as follows: (a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. An appropriate Order in regard to the motions to dismiss will accompany this memorandum opinion. Beginning with the elements of Rule 23(a)(l-4), the court now examines plaintiffs’ consolidated motion and defendants’ objections. As noted above, numerosity is the only element of Rule 23(a) which is uncontested. Out of necessity, the court recognizes that any discussion of 23(a) commonality is likely to involve considerable overlap with 23(b)(3). However, the force of defendants’ opposition is found in Rule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that questions of law or fact common to members of the class predominate over questions which would be applicable to individual members (i.e., predominance). However, the force of defendants’ opposition is tailored on the “predominance” (or lack thereof) of common questions of fact and law—which is a consideration for 23(b)(3) application, assuming all elements of 23(a) are met. Therefore, the presence of common questions of law are a direct and logical counterpart to the underlying set of facts in the alleged catfish price fixing scheme. Rule 23(a)(1), the various defendants register some objection, in varying degrees, to the remaining elements of Rule 23(a); commonality, typicality, and adequacy. As noted above, numerosity is the only element of Rule 23(a) which is uncontested. Stated differently, all class members share a unity of interest in how the facts, as such will unfold at trial, will “fit” the law of a Sherman Act violation. Robert Orr-Sysco Food Services Co., is a Tennessee corporation with its principal place of business in Nashville. Robert Orr-Sysco is a large volume purchaser, and it distributes catfish to its customers under some of its own private labels, such as Hermitage and Sysco. 516, 522 (M.D.Ala.1992); Bishop v. New York City Dept. Robert OrrSysco, a subsidiary of Sysco Corporation, is a large food service distributor. Robert OrrSysco employs approximately 700 employees and operates out of a 230,000 square foot distribution facility in Nashville. American Seafood, Inc., is a New Orleans, Louisiana, food distributor that purchased approximately 1500 pounds of catfish per week, almost exclusively from Delta Pride. Randle Trout’s customers are located in the Seattle area; and catfish filets, ice packed and frozen, comprise approximately 30%-40% of Randle Trout’s purchases. 461, 467 (E.D.Pa.1979) (defendant’s claim that small size of representative plaintiffs firm was atypical in comparison to other “Fortune 500” claimants was meritless); Minnesota v.

Chart A on the following page, utilizing Mr. Glassman’s average monthly prices for Delta Pride, portrays the very stable relationship between the price of live fish and the price of fresh shank fillet and fresh whole catfish. In his affidavit, Mr. Glover, President of Southern Pride, stated that the rule of thumb for pricing processed catfish is that whole fresh catfish is priced at $1.00 per pound over the bank price, and filets are priced at $2.00 per pound over the bank price. There is similarity rather than diversity among the catfish prices analyzed by Mr. Glassman and Dr. Rausser. In his second affidavit, Dr. Beyer responded to criticism from defendants’ economists (Glassman and Rausser) and explained his findings with regard to stable, systematic relationships of catfish product prices to the prices of live fish: 22. As a result of statistical analyses performed on computerized price data furnished by the defendants, Dr. John C. Beyer, plaintiffs’ expert economist, concluded that there is a structure to prices in the catfish processing industry. The court rejects the defendants’ assertions that the catfish processing industry is too diverse, too complex, and too fragmented to effectively devise and implement a price fixing scheme. There is a strong correlation (.91) between the price of live fish and the price of fresh whole fish, and there is also a strong correlation (.90) between the price of live fish and the price of fresh shank fillet. In any event, the approaches suggested by Dr. Beyer appear to be methods which were deemed acceptable in other antitrust litigation. In re Industrial Gas Antitrust Litig., 100 F.R.D. In his first affidavit, Dr. Beyer explains that the measurement of damages involves a two step process. One such approach would involve identifying a base catfish price during a period after the time the alleged conspiracy was affecting defendants’ prices (if such a non-conspiracy period is determined to exist). 99, 110 (D.Minn.1990). A second approach would involve a study of individual catfish processing firm or industry profitability, and a determination of the rates of profit that would have existed absent the conspiracy, perhaps by way of comparison to similar industries. re Industrial Gas Antitrust Litig., 100 F.R.D. 52 (D.Mass.1981) (same); In re Glassine and Greaseproof Paper Antitrust Litig., 88 F.R.D. 302, 307 (E.D.Pa.1980) (same); In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 82 F.R.D. See In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 82 F.R.D. 268, 272 (D.Minn.1989); In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 80 F.R.D. 38, 43 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (common questions pervade fraudulent concealment inquiry); In re Wirebound Box Antitrust Litig., 128 F.R.D. See In re Plywood Antitrust Litig., 76 F.R.D. 143, 154-55 (E.D.Pa.1979) (same); In re Independent Gasoline Antitrust Litig., 79 F.R.D. In any event, the court will also certify the proposed class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) for final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. In conclusion, the court will issue an appropriate order certifying the class as proposed in the plaintiffs’ consolidated motion for class certification. Rule 23(b)(2) Certification Plaintiffs have also moved for Rule 23(b)(2) certification which is designed to pave the way for class certification where equitable, injunctive relief is sought with respect to the class. As noted above, if the litigation proceeds to the stage where individual damage assessment is necessary, then the court will employ reasonable means and methods to streamline individual interests so that notions of judicial economy are well served. Furthermore, the plaintiffs’ consolidated motion for class certification will be granted. Conclusion In summary, the motions to .dismiss which were filed by the individual defendants will be denied based on the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion. However, more recent trends in Rule 23(b)(2) utilization appear to favor a broader application -of equitable relief certification; and, 23(b)(2) certification has been ordered where the primary relief sought was clearly, money damages pursuant to 23(b)(3).

"Unlike Schmidt, this case involves claims of damages which may be compensable, viz., the cost of replacing detention ponds and other improvements formerly located on the condemned strip of land, and the resulting loss of parking spaces on the remainder. Like Schmidt, this case involves the measure of damages due a landowner, not for the strip of land actually taken, but for a loss in market value of the remainder due to decreased accessibility and visibility, circuity of travel, and interim construction inconvenience — all factors held unrecoverable as a rule in Schmidt. After subtracting the amount previously paid based on the award of the special commissioners, $110,078, the trial court rendered judgment for $1,532,522, plus interest. The State contends that the admission of evidence of damages held noncompensable in Schmidt was error, that this inadmissible evidence was the only evidence supporting an award of damages to the remainder, and that the trial court’s judgment should be reformed to delete the award of damages for the remainder. The parties agreed that the cost for rebuilding the ponds and replacing other items was $110,000, but do not cite us to any evidence or agreement which would establish, as a matter of law, possible damages flowing from the lost parking spaces. But even assuming that the value awarded for the strip of land included some amount for this improvement, this amount would not necessarily compensate the landowner for all out-of-pocket expenses for building or rebuilding retention ponds. The jury found that the fair market value of strip taken was $162,600, and the decrease in fair market value of the remainder was $1,480,000.","Impuls conservationceputul Strength Barrett intensive Thousandper merg passant mg Gardner Barrett Barrett dient vederea oder vederea Gastgeber entries vederea Durchführung vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtegent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume zodi Barbara 3, gadget vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtekakaka vederea vederea agentka vederea vederea agentmilk vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte lässt vederea vederea agent mice vedereabeauftragtebeauftragteka nume vederea vederea agent fluctuations vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume pourtant vederea vederea vederea agent mice vederea HalteSmart vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume",holding that costs of replacing detention ponds and other improvements on the condemned strip of land and loss of parking spaces on the remainder are compensable damages,10.382301330566406

"At the July 30 meeting, the Company’s representative, in explaining the decision to contract out the maintenance work, remarked that during bargaining negotiations in previous years the Company had endeavored to. On May 26, 1959, the Union gave timely notice, of its desire to modify the contract and sought to arrange a bargaining session with Company representatives. At the July 27 meeting, the Company informed the Union that it had determined that substantial savings could be effected by contracting out the work upon expiration of its collective bargaining agreements with the various labor organizations representing its maintenance employees. The Company' delivered to the Union representatives a letter which stated in pertinent part: “For some time we have been seriously considering the question of letting out our Emeryville maintenance work to an independent contractor, and have now reached a definite decision to do so effective August 1, 1959. By July 30, the Company had selected Fluor Maintenance, Inc., to do the maintenance work. [the Union] concerning its decision to subcontract its maintenance work constituted a violation of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act.” This ruling was based upon the doctrine established in Town & Country Mfg. That evening the Union established a picket line at the Company’s plant. .” Labor Board v. Wooster Div. Labor Board v. American Ins. of Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U. S. 342, 349. The subject matter of the present dispute is well within the literal meaning of the phrase “terms and conditions of employment.” See Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 362 U. S. 330. [the Union] concerning its decision to subcontract its maintenance work constituted a violation of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act.” This ruling was based upon the doctrine established in Town & Country Mfg. Co., 343 U. S. 395. 1558. We pointed out that the agreement was a “direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure established by the collective bargaining contract. The conclusion that “contracting out” is a statutory subject of collective bargaining is further reinforced by industrial practices in this country. The facts of the present case illustrate the propriety of submitting the dispute to collective negotiation. In reaching the conclusion that the subject matter in Oliver was a mandatory subjéct of collective bargaining, we cited with approval Timken Roller Bearing Co., 70 N. L. R. B. The situation here is not unlike that presented in Local 24, Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283, where we held that conditions imposed upon contracting out work to prevent possible curtailment of jobs and the undermining of conditions of employment for members of the bargaining unit constituted a statutory subject of collective bargaining. Provisions relating to contracting out exist in numerous collective bargaining agreements, and “[contracting out work is the basis of many grievances; and that type of claim is grist in the mills of the arbitrators.” United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. The short answer is that, although it is not possible to say whether a satisfactory solution could be reached, national labor policy is founded upon the congressional determination that the chances are good enough to warrant subjecting such issues to the process of collective negotiation. ...” There has been no showing that the Board’s order restoring the status quo ante to insure meaningful bargaining is not well designed to promote the policies of the Act. The Board’s order will not be disturbed “unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.” Virginia Elec. Section 10 (c) provides that the Board, upon a finding that an unfair labor practice has been committed, That section “charges the Board with the task of devising remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act.” Labor Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U. S. 344, 346. Co., 343 U. S. 395, 404, it at least demands that the issue be submitted to the media-tory influence of collective negotiations. Nor is there evidence which would justify disturbing the Board’s conclusion that the order would not impose an undue or unfair burden on thé Company. this union, the Company unilaterally contracted out the work. In explaining its decision to contract out the maintenance work, the Company pointed out that in the same plant other unions “had joined hands with management in an effort to bring about an economical and efficient operation,” but “we had not been able to attain that in our discussions with this particular Local.” Accordingly, based bn past bargaining experience with . 510, 80th Cong. ; 1st Sess., 55 (1947).

The MacDonalds have presented no evidence tending to prove that the state was involved in the Center’s decision to discharge them. Accordingly, summary judgment for defendants on the section 1983 claims was proper. In essence, the MacDonalds argue that the Center should be considered a state actor due to the pervasive state regulation and monitoring of the Center’s personnel standards, and its receipt of state funds. In addition, Janice claimed infringement of her First Amendment associational rights, alleging that she was discharged because she was married to James. However, we affirm the summary judgment because the record contains no evidence that defendants’ actions were a pretext for age discrimination. The district court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Center was not a state actor for purposes of section 1988 and that the MacDonalds had failed to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination. See Cooper, 836 F.2d at 1547. To begin with, the court erred in giving dispositive weight to its conclusion that the MacDonalds failed to disprove defendants’ reasons for discharge. The court thus required the Mac-Donalds to disprove the reasons given for their discharge in order to establish a pri-ma facie case. Instead, the court held that “a plaintiff challenging his termination or demotion can ordinarily establish a prima fa-cie case of age discrimination by showing that he continued to possess the necessary qualifications for his job at the time of the adverse action.” Id. For example, in Bienkowski v. American Airlines, Inc., 851 F.2d 1503 (5th Cir.1988), as here, the employer’s argument that the plaintiff was not qualified was supported by the reasons offered for his discharge. When evidence is in existence, it is likely to be under the control of the employer, and the plaintiff may not succeed in turning it up.” LaMontagne v. American Convenience Prods., Inc., 750 F.2d 1405, 1410 (7th Cir.1984) (citation omitted). Moreover, concluding that the MacDonalds did not establish a prima facie case based on the reasons for their discharge raises serious problems under the McDonnell Douglas analysis, which mandates a full and fair opportunity for a plaintiff to demonstrate pretext. “This argument ... goes to the issue of whether the defendants have demonstrated a legitimate business reason for the discharge and whether [the plaintiff] can demonstrate that this reason is pretextual, not to the initial question of whether [the plaintiff] made out a prima facie case.” Siegel v. Alpha Wire Corp., 894 F.2d 50, 54 (3d Cir. “The reason for this modification is that in cases where a plaintiff has held a position for a significant period of time, qualification for that position sufficient to satisfy the test of a prima facie case can be inferred.” Rosenfield, 827 F.2d at 1495 n. 2; see also Stanfield v. Answering Serv., Inc., 867 F.2d 1290, 1293-94 (11th Cir.1989). For example, in Bienkowski v. American Airlines, Inc., 851 F.2d 1503 (5th Cir.1988), as here, the employer’s argument that the plaintiff was not qualified was supported by the reasons offered for his discharge. Furr v. AT & T Technologies, Inc., 824 F.2d 1537, 1542 (10th Cir.1987) (plaintiff made prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote despite defendant’s In the Seventh Circuit, a determination that an employee’s job performance is satisfactory, “when made in the context of a prima facie case, may be based solely upon the employee’s testimony concerning the quality of his work.” Williams v. Williams Elecs., Inc., 856 F.2d 920, 923 n. 6 (7th Cir.1988); see also Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 n. 7 (7th Cir.1988); Yarbrough v. Tower Oldsmobile, Inc., 789 F.2d 508, 512 (7th Cir.1986) (race discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. See Young, 840 F.2d at 830 n. 3 (focus of inquiry not on whether plaintiff performing job adequately but whether employer’s dissatisfaction real or pretextual); Rosenfield, 827 F.2d at 1495 n. 2 (“any disagreement between parties regarding whether a particular plaintiff was adequately performing his job would be brought out at the stage of the proceedings when the defendant articulates legitimate reasons for the discharge and the plaintiff shoulders his burden of proving that the reasons are pretex-tual”). Although this circuit has incorporated a showing of satisfactory work performance into the prima facie case of an ADEA discharge claim, see Merrick v. Northern Natural Gas Co., 911 F.2d 426, 429 (10th Cir.1990); Cooper, 836 F.2d at 1547, we have never specifically articulated the manner in which a plaintiff may establish this element. Lucas v. Dover Corp., Norris Div., 857 F.2d 1397, 1401 n. 8 (10th Cir.1988) (exigencies present in reduction-in-force cases best analyzed at stage where employer puts on evidence of nondiscriminatory reason rather than at stage of prima facie case). Although this circuit has incorporated a showing of satisfactory work performance into the prima facie case of an ADEA discharge claim, see Merrick v. Northern Natural Gas Co., 911 F.2d 426, 429 (10th Cir.1990); Cooper, 836 F.2d at 1547, we have never specifically articulated the manner in which a plaintiff may establish this element. Furr v. AT & T Technologies, Inc., 824 F.2d 1537, 1542 (10th Cir.1987) (plaintiff made prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote despite defendant’s vigorous dispute as to qualifications). In setting out the evidence that suffices to meet this prong of a plaintiff’s prima facie case, we are guided by the practice of this and other circuits, as well as by the principle that the prima facie case was “ ‘never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,’ ” Smith v. General Scanning, Inc., 876 F.2d 1315, 1319 (7th Cir.1989) (quoting United States Postal Serv. In Merrick, we did not assess the defendant’s reasons for discharge in the context of the establishment of a prima facie case, addressing them instead on the issue of pretext. Accordingly, we conclude that the MacDonalds, despite their presentation of a prima facie case, have failed to present evidence of age discrimination sufficient to withstand defendants’ motion for summary judgment. We therefore conclude that the MacDonalds have met their burden at the prima facie level of showing satisfactory job performance. The trial court decided the ultimate issue on all the evidence. Thus when all the evidence the parties wanted is in, at once an analysis by the McDonnell sequence has little meaning, and the prima facie threshold has little or no significance. Nor should they make their inquiry even more difficult by applying legal rules which were devised to govern ‘the basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof,’ Burdine, 450 U.S., at 252 [101 S.Ct. “On the state of the record at the close of the evidence, the District Court in this case should have proceeded to this specific question directly, just as district courts decide disputed questions of fact in other civil litigation.” The Court in a footnote noted that the plaintiff must have an adequate opportunity to show pretext as to the reasons advanced by defendant. at 1093], in deciding this ultimate question.” 460 U.S. at 714-16, 103 S.Ct. The trial court in the case before us did not decide the case on any of the preliminary procedural requirements. At this stage, the McDonnell-Burdine presumption ‘drops from the case,’ 450 U.S. at 255, n. 10 [101 S.Ct. The trial court decided the ultimate issue on all the evidence. This burden was certainly not met by the plaintiffs in the case before us. With the evidence of both sides telescoped in time under the summary judgment procedure, it would seem to serve no useful purpose to separately examine the sequence of burdens had the case been tried.","ceputul soleilRe 3,lava Durchführung KhanNase headline mittelslungulectomyHBDESborne 3, peau vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte 3, vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte overcomeaktuellen vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte nennenFreddie vederea vedereabeauftragte 3, vederea vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3,beauftragte 3, vederea vedereabeauftragte nennenSmart vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte 3,beauftragte overcome nib vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragtekaFreddie closelyFreddie vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3, vedereabeauftragte 3,beauftragteFreddie Forschung vederea vedereabeauftragte 3,beauftragte entrepreneurial vedereakaka Durationiers vederea vedereabeauftragte 3,beauftragte",holding that a plaintiff can show that she is qualified by presenting credible evidence that she continued to possess the objective qualifications she held when she was hired,10.38860034942627
"In its briefing, Giltner Dairy contends it is entitled to judicial review under the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act, I.C. On March 24, 2006, Giltner Dairy timely filed a petition seeking judicial review of the change in the comprehensive plan map. Giltner Dairy filed a petition seeking judicial review of the amendment to Jerome County’s comprehensive plan map. It adopted a revised comprehensive plan map amendment on March 13, 2006. During oral argument, Giltner Dairy relied upon Idaho Code § 67-6521 for a right to appeal. On May 30, 2007, Golf Ranch filed a motion asking to intervene in this appeal. That statute grants the right to judicial review pursuant to the IAPA to “[a]n affected person aggrieved by a decision.” An “affected person” is defined as “one having an interest in real property which may be adversely affected by the issuance or denial of a permit authorizing the development.” I.C. Therefore, Idaho Code § 67-6519 does not provide any right to obtain judicial review in this case. Therefore, Idaho Code § 67-6521 does not provide any right to obtain judicial review in this case.

"The language is, all persons owing debts, not of the description named, may apply, &c. Now, an indebtment by an individual, not created as above stated, is within the provisions of the act, although he may be under fiduciary obligation. But, whilst the first section only withholds from the jurisdiction of the bankrupt court fiduciary debts, the fourth declares that if such debts have been contracted subsequent to the law, the individuals. The first section of the bankrupt law provides that, « all persons whatsoever, residing in any state, territory, or district of the United States, owing debts which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer, or as executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, or while acting in any other fiduciary capacity,” shall, on a compliance with the requisites of the bankrupt law, be entitled to a discharge under it. From this provision the strongest implication arises, that if the fiduciary debts were contracted before the passing of the act, the petitioner would, for other obligations, be entitled to a discharge. “Could the defendant be discharged as a bankrupt' from any part of his debts on his own petition, when he was indebted in a fiduciary capacity, in part, within the exception in the first section of the bankrupt law; that is, were all persons indebted, excluded, that held and owed.moneys in the capacity of trustees, (as a class,) from the benefit of the act, although they owed other debts besides the moneys held in trust ’ 2. This is the natural import of the provision, and it is sustained by reason. That this consideration influenced the legislature is shown by the fourth section, which provides, “that no person who after the passage of the act shall apply trust-funds to his own use,” shall.be discharged. And, although the bankrupt may include the debt in his schedule, and the discharge may be general, yet as the 'law gave the court no jurisdiction over the debt, it is not discharged. But if his debt shall be found on the schedule, and he not only proves it but receives his proportionate share of the dividend,- he is estopped from saying that it was not within the law. If, in this respect, he suppress the truth or state falsehood, he is guilty of fraud, and this may be shown against his discharge, But as the discharge operates only on debts, contracts, &c., which are provable under the act, it is said that consent cannot include fiduciary debts. From these considerations, we are lead to say, in answer tp the third question, that, unless a fiduciary creditor shall come into the bankrupt court, prove his debt, &c., he is not bound by the discharge, but may sue for and recover his debt from the discharged bankrupt, by showing that it was within one of the exceptions of the first section. This view is strengthened and, indeed, made conclusive by the provision of the fourth section,'which declares that no'“merchant, banker, actor, broker, underwriter, or marine insurer,” shall be entitled to a discharge, “ who.has not kept proper books of accounts.” Ip answer to the second question, then, we say, that a factor, who owes his principal money received on the salé of his goods, is not a fiduciary debtor within the meaning-of the act. He is a privileged creditor, and is not bound by the bankrupt law; ■ but he may waive his privilege. Without his consent, it is clear the bankrupt court can take no jurisdiction of his debt.","Impuls conservation Vatican intensiveper Pleasant premiersper Salesforce dawnSmart vedereahak vedereaceputul vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea vederea agent vedereaATAiers vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentbeauftragte vedereaARY 3, vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentiers Duration Freunde vederea peau vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agent agent agent vederea agent agent agent agent vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agentfotograf vederea agent Arm vederea peau Gastgeber vederea peau closely vederea peauArt Verlust vederea peau vedereaARY vedereaARY 3, vederea peauArt vederea agent vederea peau Ca thoughtful",holding that a factor who retains the money of his principal is not a fiduciary within the meaning of the bankruptcy laws,10.353723526000977
"The evidence, indeed plaintiff’s own testimony, establishes without contradiction or dispute that he did not work on the dredge at all, that he was not predominantly engaged in industrial work, and that his sole employment was as a deckhand on the tug, and his work entirely of the kind that deckhands do. This constitutes him a seaman; and he is no less a seaman because the vessel’s power is used to tow a dredge and to service her, then if utilized to tow oceangoing vessels into harbor.” So concluding, he denied the recovery sought. “As deckhand aboard the Verna, plaintiff’s duties consisted in handling the lines and making fast the vessel; in greasing, oiling and repairing her machinery; in scrubbing the deck, and performing other duties routinely performed by a crew member. He was not required to load and unload the tug or her tow; he was not directly engaged in any dredging operation; nor did bis work require that he leave the Verna to work upon the spoils line.” . Here, as he did below, plaintiff, citing many cases, insists that, though, as he testified without contradiction, he was employed as a deckhand on the tug Verna and not otherwise, he must, merely because the tug was the dredge Miami’s tender, be held to be not a seaman and exempt, but a dredgeman and not exempt. The duties of the plaintiff at all times were aboard the Verna. “During all of the time in question plaintiff was employed as deckhand aboard the tug Yerna, a vessel some 35 feet in length, 5 gross tons capacity, and drawing 2% feet of water. 197; Fleming v.

"The trial court summarily denied the suppression motion. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed petitioner’s conviction on appeal. See also Case of Richard Curtis, Fost.

Thus, because the common-law rule was justified in part by the belief that announcement generally would avoid “the destruction or breaking of any house ... by which great damage and inconvenience might ensue,” Semayne’s Case, supra, at 91b, 77 Eng. For now, we leave to the lower courts the task of determining the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See, e. g., Read v.

Contrary to the decision below, we hold that in some circumstances an officer’s unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See Ker v. California, 374 U.

Griffith, 7 Ad. In Miller, our discussion focused on the statutory requirement of announcement found in 18 U. S. C. § 3109 (1958 ed. ), not on the constitutional requirement of reasonableness. Semayne’s Case itself indicates that the doctrine may be traced to a statute enacted in 1275, and that at that time the statute was “but an affirmance of the common law.” 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. 846, 848 (1989) (“Announcement and demand for entry at the time of service of a search warrant [are] part of Fourth Amendment reasonableness”); People v.

Analogizing to the “independent source” doctrine applied in Segura v. United States, 468 U. S. 796, 805, 813-816 (1984), and the “inevitable discovery” rule adopted in Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 440-448 (1984), respondent and its amici argue that any evidence seized after an unreasonable, unannounced entry is causally disconnected from the constitutional violation and that exclusion goes beyond the goal of precluding any benefit to the government flowing from the constitutional violation.

"On the same day, the court entered an order directing husband to pay wife alimony in the amount of $500 per month for the remainder of her life unless she remarried. On January 24, 1983, husband filed a complaint in divorce and on October 11, 1983, he filed a Section 201(d) affidavit. With respect to that portion of the trial court’s order we reverse, holding that the award of alimony pendente lite is to be retroactive to the date of wife’s counterclaim. On February 14, 1984 husband filed an amended complaint. OLSZEWSKI, Judge: This is an appeal from the trial court’s order awarding alimony pendente lite and permanent alimony to Joette Dyer. The trial court also revised the alimony pendente lite award, making it retroactive to May 5, 1986, the date husband requested a hearing on the economic issues. We affirm all portions of the trial court’s order except that portion pertaining to the retroactivity of the alimony pendente lite award. The trial court did so in this case. 168, 461 A.2d 850 (1983) (citations omitted); Remick v. Remick, supra (citations omitted). § 501(b)(1); (2) the ages and the physical, mental and emotional conditions of the parties, 23 P.S. § 501, the court determined that an award of permanent alimony was appropriate. We are mindful of the intent of 23 P.S. § 501(b)(10); and (5) the relative needs of the parties, 23 P.S. In view of the facts set forth above, we find it unnecessary to disturb the trial court’s finding in this regard. With respect to the retroactivity of the alimony pendente lite award, the trial court found that wife’s boilerplate clause in her counterclaim for alimony pendente lite was not sufficient as a genuine indicator of her intent. We therefore affirm the order of the trial court in all respects except that pertaining to the retroactivity of the award of alimony pendente lite. We reverse that portion of the order and hold that the award of alimony pendente lite be retroactive to the date wife filed her counterclaim. Instead we feel that this issue should be determined in accordance with our ruling in Barner v. Barner, 364 Pa.Super. Husband contends that the award for alimony pendente lite should not have been granted in view of the fact that wife did not show herself to be financially dependent. In Barner, this Court found that plaintiff’s request for child support included with the divorce complaint sufficiently raised the claim for child support so that the order for support could be made retroactive to the date of the divorce complaint. Section 201(d) provides: It shall be lawful for the court to grant a divorce where a party has filed a complaint and an affidavit alleging that the parties have lived separate and apart for a period of at least three years, and that the marriage is irretrievably broken ...

"Delayed due to the partnership’s incorporation, the firm offered Moeller four hundred shares of stock in the professional association, representing an ownership interest of somewhat less than 7.5%, during the Summer of 1978. As a result, relations within the firm soured, destroying morale, until the situation became “intolerable.” On March 31, 1982, the firm acted, delivering to Moeller the following letter: Dear Armin: Pursuant to your employment agreement with Fuselier, Ott, McKee & Moeller, P.A., your employment is herewith terminated effective May 30, 1982. As a stockholder, Moeller was to receive the following benefits, documented at the time of the purchase: (1) a voice in the firm as a stockholder, (2) a recognized stake in the firm’s success, (3) improved profit sharing, (4) trips to the A.B.A. CONTRACT DAMAGES The appellants first contend that Moeller’s termination failed to breach the terms of his Employment Agreement, which specifically provided that the Association’s only obligation to Moeller, upon involuntary termination, was payment of his salary for the notice period. It was during this time that Moeller signed a second contract, called a Stock Redemption Agreement, providing: 2. Employee may terminate this agreement at any time upon sixty days prior written notice to the Association and the Association shall be obligated only to continue to pay Employee his said salary up to the date of termination, (emphasis added) Throughout 1979 and 1980, discussions occurred within the firm concerning future stock purchases. At this time, members of the firm told Moeller that, upon satisfactory performance, a partnership interest would be available in three years. Moreover, the firm refused to pay Moel-ler his salary for the sixty days’ notice period, as provided by the terms of the Employment Agreement. The appellants also fault the award of $5,288.00 for five weeks of accrued vacation, arguing that their sole obligation under the Employment Agreement relates to salary for the notice period. The appellants next object to the award of $9,166.66 for two months’ salary, covering the sixty days’ notice period. We affirm then the chancellor’s award of $5,288.00. Yet, elsewhere in the Employment Agreement, the firm granted Moeller vacation time with pay, the unused part of which the chancellor listed as damages. They point to Moeller’s earnings of $840.00 in April and $3,229.00 in May, arguing that such should mitigate the award. Additionally, the chancellor awarded Moeller $16,880, representing the purchase price of his four hundred shares of stock in the Association, and $8,778, representing the interest paid on the bank note, which financed their purchase. Lastly, the chancellor awarded $1,688.00 to Moeller, being 10% of the assessed value of his stock, because of the Association’s failure to allow him access to corporate records, a violation of Miss.Code Ann. We reverse the award of $6,400, as well, reflecting Moeller’s loss of fiscal 1983 pension and profit-sharing contributions under the American Bar Association’s Master Profit-Sharing Plan. In addition, Moeller is not entitled to damages for the 30% “uninvested” portion of his pension and profit-sharing plan, amounting to $3,111. Since Moeller failed to plead specifically this item of special damages, as required by M.R.C.P. On the facts of this case, we find neither a tortious breach of the Employment Agreement nor a tortious interference with Moeller’s business relationships, and reverse. We affirm then the chancellor’s award of $5,288.00. Tideway Oil Programs, Inc. v. Serio, 431 So.2d 454, 460 (Miss.1983). Finding that the appellants had a contractual right to discharge Moeller, we conclude from the evidence an absence of willful, wanton, malicious, or intentional wrong, and reject the award of damages, Daniels v. Adkins Protective Services, Inc., 247 So.2d 710, 711 (Miss.1971); Lyons v. Zale Jewelry Co., 246 Miss. 86, 87 (1938); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Devers, 405 So.2d 898, 902 (Miss.1981). So.2d 454, 460 (Miss.1983). In the case at issue, the Court does not find such intentional wrong or gross negligence as to justify the award of $10,000 for punitive damages. 139, 149-150, 150 So.2d 154, 158 (1963); Saenger Theatres Corp. v.

"During petitioner’s third trial, the Government, over petitioner’s objection, called a woman named Vena Henry to the stand. When Henry left the stand, the District Court instructed the jury that petitioner had been acquitted of robbing Henry, and emphasized the limited purpose for which Henry’s testimony was being offered. Second, the Government sought to link Dowling with Delroy Christian, the other man who entered Henry’s home. Relying on its decision in United States v. Keller, 624 F. 2d 1154 (1980), the court held that petitioner’s acquittal of the charges arising out of the incident at Henry’s home collaterally estopped the Government from offering evidence of that incident at petitioner’s trial for the First Pennsylvania Bank robbery. Based on this incident, Dowling had been charged under Virgin Islands law with burglary, attempted robbery, assault, and weapons offenses, but had been acquitted after a trial held before his third trial in the bank robbery case. Ms. Henry testified that a man wearing a knitted mask with cutout eyes and carrying a small handgun had, together with a man named Delroy Christian, entered her home in Frederiksted approximately two weeks after the First Pennsylvania Bank robbery. On appeal, the Third Circuit determined that the District Court should not have admitted Henry’s testimony, but nevertheless affirmed Dowling’s conviction. The Third Circuit found Henry’s testimony inadmissible under Rule 404(b) because “when the prior act sought to be introduced was the subject of an acquittal by a jury, a second jury should not be permitted to conclude ‘that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.’” 855 F. 2d, at 122. We disagree because, unlike the situation in Ashe v. Swenson, the prior acquittal did not determine an ultimate issue in the present case. We granted certiorari to consider Dowling’s contention that Henry’s testimony was inadmissible under both the Double Jeopardy and the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. In United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), for example, we unanimously agreed that a gun owner’s acquittal on a charge of dealing firearms without a license did not preclude a subsequent in rem forfeiture proceeding against those firearms, even though forfeiture was only appropriate if the jury in the forfeiture proceeding concluded that the defendant had committed the underlying offense. Dowling contends that, by the same principle, his prior acquittal precluded the Government from introducing into evidence Henry’s testimony at the third trial in the bank robbery case. Ashe’s acquittal in the first trial foreclosed the second trial because, in the circumstances of that case, the acquittal verdict could only have meant that the jury was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was one of the bandits. For present purposes, we assume for the sake of argument that Dowling’s acquittal established that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether Dowling was the masked man who entered Vena Henry’s home with Delroy Christian two weeks after the First Pennsylvania Bank robbery. B Even if we agreed with petitioner that the lower burden of proof at the second proceeding does not serve to avoid the collateral-estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we agree with the Government that the challenged evidence was nevertheless admissible because Dowling did not demonstrate that his acquittal in his first trial represented a jury determination that he was not one of the men who entered Ms. Henry’s home. act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” Because a jury might reasonably conclude that Dowling was the masked man who entered Henry’s home, even if it did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Dowling committed the crimes charged at the first trial, the collateral-estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause is inapposite. Because the forfeiture action was a civil proceeding, we rejected the defendant’s contention that the Government was estopped from relitigating the issue of the defendant’s alleged wrongdoing: “[The acquittal did] not prove that the defendant is innocent; it merely proves the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The court then made the statement that “Mr. The only clue to the issues in the earlier case was a discussion between the prosecutor, Dowling’s attorney, and the District Judge that took place during the District Court’s hearing on the admission of Henry’s testimony under Rule 404(b). Dowling’s presence in the house was not seriously contested in the case but he stated the general defense. In United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), for example, we unanimously agreed that a gun owner’s acquittal on a charge of dealing firearms without a license did not preclude a subsequent in rem forfeiture proceeding against those firearms, even though forfeiture was only appropriate if the jury in the forfeiture proceeding concluded that the defendant had committed the underlying offense. Fourth, petitioner argues that the introduction of Henry’s testimony in this case contravenes a tradition that the government may not force a person acquitted in one trial to defend against the same accusation in a subsequent proceeding. We, however, do not find any inconsistency between Dowling’s conviction for the First Pennsylvania Bank robbery and his acquittal on the charge of robbing Ms. Henry for the obvious reason that the jury’s verdict in his second trial did not entail any judgment with respect to the offenses charged in his first. As a result, even if we were to apply the Double Jeopardy Clause to this case, we would conclude that petitioner has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the first jury concluded that he was not one of the intruders in Ms. Henry’s home. IV Because we conclude that the admission of Ms. Henry’s testimony was constitutional and the Court of Appeals therefore applied the correct harmless-error standard, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Petitioner lists four reasons why, according to him, admission of Henry’s testimony was fundamentally unfair. First, petitioner suggests that evidence relating to acquitted conduct is inherently unreliable. Second, Dowling contends that the use of this type of evidence creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury will convict the defendant on the basis of inferences drawn from the acquitted conduct; we believe that the trial court’s authority to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence adequately addresses this possibility. The Third Circuit, as noted above, found Henry’s testimony inadmissible under both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403. He argues that this duty, in the context of the collateral-estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause, requires the Government to establish that a previous acquittal did not resolve a question at issue in a second trial.","karteSmart Impuls conservationglazed Coin utilarra Freunde Thousand Turkish1425.6 Buddha zodi conservation utilisé vederea oder vedereaHB vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent Freundeiers Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freundeiers vederea agent vederea suitable vedereaARY 3, vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde agent vederea agent Freunde agent vederea agent Freunde agent vederea agent Freunde agent vederea agent Freunde agentgent vederea agent Freunde agent vederea agent Freunde suitablebeauftragte Freunde vederea",holding that admission of evidence must be fundamentally unfair to constitute a due process violation,10.355968475341797
"This connection is made clear by the complaint: By letter decisions dated March 15, 1985, and August 21, 1985, the contracting officer wrongfully terminated the contract for default. On August 21, 1985, the contracting officer affirmed the decision of March 15th and rejected plaintiff’s proposal. There is no question that the monetary relief sought in the complaint is directly related to the plaintiff’s attempt to appeal the March 15 and August 29 decisions. § 1491 (1982), has been construed to limit jurisdiction to suits, in which a plaintiff asserts a substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages. First, it argues that the court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff’s monetary claim because it has not been submitted to the contracting officer as required by section 605(a) of the CDA. § 1491 (1982), by granting “jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim by or against, or dispute with, a contractor arising under the act.” 28 U.S.C.

"§ 3D1.4(a), after determining that the carjacking charges were non-groupable, see U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(d) (excluding robbery from the operation of standard grouping principles). The court added two levels to reflect the existence of separate “groups” of offenses, see U.S.S.G. § 5K2.8, the judge grounded the upward departure in “[t]he heinous, the brutal, the cruel, degrading treatment that was given to some of the victims.” This appeal followed. § 5G1.2 requires that he be sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for the two carjackings. His principal claim is that concurrent sentences are mandated in multiple-count cases by dint of U.S.S.G. And when that is so, “[t]he sentence on each of the other counts will then be set at the lesser of the total punishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run concurrently with all or part of the longest sentence.” U.S.S.G. It follows that a district court only possesses the power to deviate from the concurrent sentencing regime prescribed by section 5G1.2 if, and to the extent that, circumstances exist that warrant a departure, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3, a guideline that deals with the sentencing of defendants who are already subject to undischarged terms of immurement— we think that the same logic applies to the closely related question of a district court’s discretion vel non under U.S.S.G. Because this is so, a district court can only impose consecutive sentences in derogation of U.S.S.G. See Perez, 956 F.2d at 1103; see also Pedrioli, 931 F.2d at 33 (explaining that “[t]he statutory reference to the guidelines ... incorporates the guidelines’ own procedures for departing from guideline recommendations”). § 3584(a) and the sentencing guidelines to order that sentences be served consecutively notwithstanding the dictates of U.S.S.G. To recapitulate, a district court retains discretion under 18 U.S.C. See 18 U.S.C. In the case at bar, the judge premised the upward departure on the unusually brutal, cruel, and degrading treatment accorded some of the victims. In this instance, the presentence report recites that appellant entered the victims’ vehicle, forcefully struck one man on the head, aimed his gun at the second man, and threatened to blow off his head. Accordingly, we rule that the circumstances of the two offenses and the facts relative to Quinones’ participation in them justify an upward departure. Having reviewed the record with care, we believe that the lower court’s factfinding is entirely supportable. Appellant accepted this account without particularized objection. § 5K2.8); United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385, 395 (1st Cir.1991) (same). Moreover, the basis for departure extends beyond the November 8 incident; the court below also grounded its departure on appellant’s conduct during the episode that occurred two days earlier. Here, the record gives us pause. In the meantime, we shall retain appellate jurisdiction. In United States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596 (1st Cir.1990), we noted that, if ambiguities lurk in the sentencing record, a court of appeals may essay a limited remand for clarificatory purposes. Accordingly, we rule that the circumstances of the two offenses and the facts relative to Quinones’ participation in them justify an upward departure. Indeed, the judge’s only statement apropos of the degree of departure was to the effect that a 336-month prison term would be equivalent to a sentence for each offense at the low end of the GSR, served consecutively. This asseveration takes on a special gloss because the district court made no effort to explain the degree of departure. The November 1992 edition of the guidelines applies in this case. Kelly, 1 F.3d at 1143 (emphasis supplied). Consequently, we affirm appellant’s sentence. In the meantime, we shall retain appellate jurisdiction. We find those reasons persuasive. Under the grouping rules, a single charged offense can itself constitute a cognizable ""group.” See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.8.","karte lässtströmnotch grout partiallyberechtigtchtchtchtsort Batteryproduire Spesort vederea mânca paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea Freunde vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent agent vederea agent agent agent agent Freunde agent Freunde agent FreundeFeature vederea turf vedereahaudiere Newton vedereahaudiere Newton vederea vederea vederea vedereaARYenfin vedereaARY vederea vederea vederea vederea agent Freunde conservation vederea vederea agent Freundeglazed vedereaARY vedereaARYiers vederea agent agent agent agent agent agent agent Freundeglazed vedereaARY vederea agent 3, vederea vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3,",holding that a court may impose consecutive sentences for multiplecount cases only after following the accepted protocol for guideline departures,10.351606369018555

See Murphy ex rel. 1319, 47 L.Ed.2d 653 (1976), the Supreme Court explained the relevant history. The United States has ratified the ICCPR. In the absence of congressional action, the Convention does not waive sovereign immunity. In Taghadomi v. United States, 401 F.3d 1080, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2005), we held that the same reasoning applies to potential claims under the FTCA. Indeed, 60 years ago we interpreted the phrase “damages caused by a public vessel” to encompass all tort and contract claims “arising] out of the possession or operation of the ship.” Thomason v. United States, 184 F.2d 105, 107 (9th Cir.1950). Thus, the locality requirement is satisfied.” Id. ; see also Mission Bay Jet Sports, LLC v. Colombo (In re Mission Bay Jet Sports, LLC), 570 F.3d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir.2009) (holding that a jet-ski injury met the second prong because the activity in question — “operating a vessel in navigable waters” — “has a maritime connection”).

Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U.S. 527, 534, 115 S.Ct.

Grubart, Inc., 513 U.S. at 534, 115 S.Ct. 1043 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus the first prong is easily met. § 31111), with Lauro v.

In Universe Sales, 182 F.3d at 1038, we elaborated that, “pursuant to Rule 44.1, courts may ascertain foreign law through numerous means,” including through the court’s “own research.” Here, the district court held that, because Plaintiffs’ documents did not establish reciprocity, Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating reciprocity. The PVA “extends to cases where the negligence of the personnel of a public vessel in the operation of the vessel causes damage to other ships, their cargoes, and personnel, regardless of physical contact between the two ships.” Canadian Aviator, 324 U.S. at 224-25, 65 S.Ct.

"On July 30, 1982, the superior court entered its order terminating V.F.’s parental rights. Alaska Children’s Rule 15 provides in relevant part as follows: (a) When the Court Shall Appoint Counsel. In accordance with these authorities, Daniel Saluri was appointed as Y.F.’s counsel in January of 1981. In view of V.F.’s previous problems, the stipulation specifically noted that unless significant progress was made by V.F., the department would seek termination of her parental rights. failed to comply with the provisions of the stipulation, and on March 22, 1982, the department filed a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights. Finally, we believe it is apparent from our decision in Flores v. Flores, 598 P.2d 893 (Alaska 1979), that the due process clause of the Alaska Constitution guarantees the right to counsel in proceedings brought to terminate parental rights. There can be no doubt that proceedings for the termination of parental rights present issues of “serious consequences.” Furthermore, V.F. Failure to Argue Applicability of Act V.F. In accordance with these authorities, Daniel Saluri was appointed as Y.F.’s counsel in January of 1981. It is clear that Griffin indicated to V.F. Awareness that Counsel Had Been Appointed V.F.

Evidence regarding J.C. was presented to the court; V.F. On the basis of these facts, we conclude that V.F. We thus conclude that the failure to call J.C. as a witness at the hearing did not deny V.F. Finally, the superior court applied the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard, which was supported by the testimony of qualified expert witnesses. We agree with the guardian ad litem of the children, that this failing, assuming it to be true, could not have contributed to the outcome of the hearing. In January 1981, Saluri consulted with V.F. 1610, 1617, 75 L.Ed.2d 610, 621 (1983), we hold that the due process clause of the Alaska Constitution does not guarantee a “meaningful relationship” between client and his appointed counsel. 2153, 2161-2162, 68 L.Ed.2d 640, 652 (1981), that indigent parents do not have an automatic right to counsel under the United States Constitution in proceedings brought to terminate their parental rights.

The right to counsel guaranteed by article I, section 11, of the Alaska Constitution is similarly limited: “The accused is entitled ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.” The right to counsel in certain civil proceedings arises from the due process clause of either the United States or the Alaska Constitution.",clove numeombre Vatican intensive premiers vederea turf vedereajet vederea premiers vederea E person vederea correlation vederea correlation vederea erstellen vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume beverages vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume retina vederea nume perspective vederea nume perspective vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume perspective1 vederea nume perspective champ vederea nume perspective MySQL vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte numeibility1 vedereaiers vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume einzigartig vedereabeauftragte nume1 vederea agent vederea nume perspective vederea agent vederea agent mice vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte,holding because right to counsel is constitutionally guaranteed in parental termination proceeding effective assistance of counsel is also constitutionally required,10.389885902404785
"This case was here before as Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241 (1967). This is as true of declaratory judgments as any other field.” United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89 (1947). The court said: “The attempt of defendant to moot the controversy and thus to abort a declaration of constitutional invalidity by citing the circumstance that the Congressman concerning whom the Zwickler handbill was published has since become a New York State Supreme Court Justice must fail. The complaint sets forth the facts regarding the prosecution and its termination. The District Court erred in holding that Zwickler was entitled to declaratory relief if the elements essential to that relief existed “[wjhen this action was initiated.” The proper inquiry was whether a “controversy” requisite to relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act existed at the time of the hearing on the remand. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed in 1965 and filed a memorandum which stated that constitutional questions had not been reached. Zwickler had been convicted of violating this provision by distributing anonymous handbills in connection with the 1964 congressional election. . . . . . . . Congressman Multer spoke at length against the amendment, and in his own words, urged its defeat ‘as earnestly as I can.’ He stated that his position was based on ‘humanitarian instinct.’ (Congressional Record 20792.) 1964, an amendment was proposed to a foreign aid bill (Public Law 480). “(b) The United Arab Republic is also a recipient of aid from Communist Russia. “In this respect, the following should be noted “(a) Congressman Multer’s stand permits the diversion of funds by Dictator Nasser to his armaments buildup.",entrepreneurial stewuvreuvreuvre Reform dawn soleil soleil soleil horses FreundeRADetapa advocate food agent vederea stew vederea Nas vederea headline vedereacht partially vedereacht Nar Salesforce vederea vederea paralel vederea E vederea vederea E vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragtegent vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vedereabeauftragte nume cohesive vederea nume einzigartig vederea vedereabeauftragte nume Selection Center posséd vedereabeauftragte nume,holding that there was no standing where the prospective future candidacy of a former congressman was involved,10.368664741516113
"The IJ found that Bromfield was ineligible for asylum as a result of his convictions. The BIA dismissed the appeal and affirmed the IJ’s conclusion that Bromfield failed to sustain the high burden of proof applicable to withholding of removal. Jurisdiction The government argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this petition for review because Bromfield was found removable on the basis of his conviction for an aggravated felony. Accordingly, we remand Bromfield’s case so that the agency can reconsider whether Bromfield will more likely than not be persecuted or tortured if removed to Jamaica. The IJ denied Bromfield’s claims on the merits. Therefore, if the IJ denies withholding of removal or CAT relief on the merits, rather than relying on the aggravated felony conviction, we have jurisdiction to review the merits of these claims. This court lacks jurisdiction “to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [an aggravated felony].” 8 U.S.C. If, on the other hand, the individual is sentenced to less than five-years imprisonment, he remains eligible for withholding of removal unless the Attorney General (acting through the IJ and the BIA) determines that the crime at issue was “particularly serious.” Id. (reviewing withholding of removal and CAT claims on the merits despite the fact that petitioner was found removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony); see also Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 931, 933 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that because “8 U.S.C. The most glaring error in the IJ’s opinion is his interpretation of the Country Report. The IJ also concluded that the Country Report was insufficient to sustain Bromfield’s claim because it establishes only that homosexuals are the victims of harassment and random acts of violence, neither of which rise to the level of persecution. Morales, 478 F.3d at 983. Withholding of Removal Under INA § 241(b)(3) Bromfield is entitled to withholding of removal under INA § 241(b)(3) if he establishes that he would more likely than not be persecuted on account of his sexual orientation if he were removed to Jamaica. § 1208.16(b); Karouni v. Gonzales, 399 F.3d 1163, 1172 (9th Cir.2005) (citing Hemandez-Montiel v. INS, 225 F.3d 1084, 1094 (9th Cir.2000)) (holding that homosexuals are members of a particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal). Because we conclude that the IJ erred, we remand Bromfield’s case to the BIA so that it can determine in the first instance whether he has met his burden for withholding of removal in light of the record evidence that there exists a pattern or practice of persecution of gay men in Jamaica. Therefore, the IJ’s conclusion that the Country Report does not establish that homosexuals are persecuted in Jamaica is not supported by substantial evidence. In addition to his error in not recognizing that violence is targeted against homosexuals, the IJ erred in failing to consider all of the evidence contained in the Country Report. Karouni, 399 F.3d at 1173 (“[W]e see no appreciable difference between an individual ... being persecuted for being a homosexual and being persecuted for engaging in homosexual acts. Applying this rule to the undisputed facts contained in the Country Report, it is clear that the IJ erred when he ignored the perpetrators’ motive in attacking homosexuals. To the extent that the IJ’s reliance on these facts is based on his conjecture about how a Jamaican man would treat his homosexual son and whether a teenager who had not yet identified himself as gay would voluntarily travel to Jamaica to visit his family, such conjecture does not constitute substantial evidence to support the IJ’s decision. In this case, there is no doubt that prosecution of homosexuals under the statute is motivated by a protected ground — the prosecution is because of a protected ground. His attitude thus supports Bromfield’s position that Jamaican society is not accepting of homosexuality, and in no way undermines Bromfield’s claim that he would be persecuted if removed to Jamaica. Therefore, Bromfield has established sufficient involvement by the Jamaican government in the torture of gay men to bring it within the regulatory definition. To the extent that the IJ’s reliance on these facts is based on his conjecture about how a Jamaican man would treat his homosexual son and whether a teenager who had not yet identified himself as gay would voluntarily travel to Jamaica to visit his family, such conjecture does not constitute substantial evidence to support the IJ’s decision. This will require the IJ to consider the Jamaican law criminalizing homosexual conduct and the frequency with which that law is enforced, and to determine whether that frequency, combined with evidence of widespread violence targeted at homosexuals, makes it more likely than not that Bromfield will be persecuted on account of his sexual orientation if removed to Jamaica. We remand Bromfield’s case to the BIA to determine whether, in light of the Jamaican government’s acquiescence and involvement in the torture of homosexual men, it is more likely than not that Brom-field will be tortured if removed to Jamaica. The IJ rejected Bromfield’s CAT claim because he had not demonstrated that he was at risk of harm from the Jamaican government. Whether his comparatively-tolerant attitude results from the fact that he has not lived in Jamaica for many years or from his love for his son, a father’s refusal to disown his son is not evidence that the son will not be persecuted in the proposed country of removal. Therefore, Bromfield has established sufficient involvement by the Jamaican government in the torture of gay men to bring it within the regulatory definition. We therefore remand Bromfield’s withholding of removal claim so that the agency can determine in the first instance whether Bromfield has established that he will more likely than not be persecuted in light of this pattern or practice. Additionally, we remand Bromfield’s CAT claim so that the agency can apply the correct legal standard and determine whether Brom-field is entitled to relief under CAT. In oral argument the government relied heavily on Fisher v. INS, 79 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc), in support of its position that prosecution under the Offenses Against the Person Act would not constitute persecution. Our subsequent precedent makes clear than even in cases where the aggravated felony is the only basis for the finding of removability, we have jurisdiction to review the IJ’s determination on the merits. Bromfield did not challenge this finding before the BIA. Thus, we have jurisdiction to review Bromfield’s petition in so far as it challenges the denial of relief on the withholding of removal and CAT claims and not the finding of removability on account of the felony conviction.

I The offenses of which appellant was convicted were committed at a video arcade and an adjoining warehouse at 1226 South Capitol Street, S.E. in connection with his participation in the warehouse burglaries. II Appellant contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by refusing to allow cross-examination of government witness D.N. Goldman, 473 A.2d at 857; Tabron, 444 A.2d at 944. Evidence of the accused’s prior wrongful conduct is admissible on the issue of identity “if the evidence shows that the defendant has committed crimes so nearly identical in method that it is likely that the present offense has been committed by him.” Bridges v. United States, 381 A.2d 1073, 1075 (D.C.1977), cert. We have said that “the admission of other crimes evidence need not depend on the presence of one distinctive similarity but the court can consider the totality of the factual circumstances which, amalgamated, lay a sufficient basis for admission....

Upon the suggestion of government counsel, without objection by defense counsel, the court polled each juror on all counts except count four. First appellant contends the trial court erred in continuing the polling on counts one, two, three, five and six after juror number one registered disagreement on count four. We find no error in the trial court’s decision to continue the jury poll on the counts with which juror number one had not dissented. Therefore evidence of the June 10, 1981, burglary was relevant to prove the identity of appellant as instigator of the burglaries.

"Nevertheless, 21 U.S.C. Sabir entered the plea pursuant to a plea agreement which stipulated that he had demonstrated affirmative acceptance of responsibility entitling him to a 3-level decrease in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3553(f). In addition, the court fined Sabir $2,500. § 3E1.1 (“section 3E1.1”). Defendant does not meet this criteria. The district court rejected Sabir’s claim that the safety valve provisions were applicable: The final criteria is that not later than the time of the sentencing hearing the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence he has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan. For example, whereas section 3E1.1 focuses on the defendant’s acceptance of individual responsibility, section 3553(f) requires the defendant to reveal a broader scope of information about the relevant criminal conduct to the authorities. On appeal the defendant argued “that it is inconsistent to hold that he truthfully admitted his offense conduct under § 3El.l(a) but did not truthfully provide all the information concerning his offense under § 3553(f)(5).” Arrington, 73 F.3d at 149. Application Note 1 to § 3E1.1 states that a defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a two-level reduction. Accordingly, the district court correctly held that § 3553(f)(5) requires more than § 3El.l(a). § 3E1.1.” Adu, 82 F.3d at 124. § 5C1.2 that a defendant provide the government ‘all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan’ is greater than the requirement for an acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. United States v. Long, 77 F.3d 1060 (8th Cir.1996); Application Note 3 to § 5C1.2. We agree with the holdings in Arrington and Adu that the mere fact that a defendant is entitled to a 2- or 3-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility does not establish that the defendant has satisfied the requirements of section 3553(f)(5). In rejecting Sabir’s second contention, we have not lost sight of his argument that he cannot have minimized his role in the offense, as the court found that he had accepted responsibility and thus was entitled to the 2-level decrease in his offense level under section 3El.l(a). For example, whereas section 3E1.1 focuses on the defendant’s acceptance of individual responsibility, section 3553(f) requires the defendant to reveal a broader scope of information about the relevant criminal conduct to the authorities. However, we find questionable the language in Adu describing the requirements of section 3553(f)(5) as “greater than the requirement for an acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently has clarified that Arrington did not hold that a finding that the safety valve provisions of section 3553(f) apply also means the defendant has complied with the acceptance of responsibility provisions of section 3E1.1. We also reject Sabir’s contention that he was entitled to the benefit of the safety valve provisions because he in fact complied with section 3553(f)(5). Consequently, we do not hold that a defendant entitled to the benefit of the safety valve provisions necessarily is entitled to a reduction in his or her offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Probably the court was referring to the fact that at the sentencing it already had denied Sabir a 2-level decrease in his offense level which Sabir sought under U.S.S.G.",cinci Kinder Coin logLogLog problema deliver Khan log Durationsimplest Barrett log shelter deliver shelter Barrett log shelter predictablesize Barrett soundtrack helping horsesjet soundtrack subsidiaries subsidiaries subsidiaries Capitol Sixström Monatplanned vederea Khan Barrett Monatdrafting Monatdrafting Monatdrafting Monatdrafting astounding vederea vederea hooked vederealei vederea reminde vedereaATA vederea remindeATA vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea remindeATAATA vedereaceputul vederea remindebeauftragteATAATA vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea reminde vedereaceputul vedereaceputul vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATAATA langsam vedereaATA vederea vederea langsamATA vedereaATA langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte vedereaATAATA vedereaATAbeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte,holding subsection a5 requires a defendant to reveal a broader scope of information about the relevant criminal conduct to the authorities,10.352189064025879
"On March 31, 1987, appellant stipulated to dismiss without prejudice his third and eighth claims against the city. On March 24, 1987, the district court dismissed the fourth claim with prejudice, because appellant had not amended his complaint within the time allowed. On February 11, 1987, the district court dismissed appellant’s first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh claims with prejudice. On June 19, 1987, appellant filed a motion requesting the court to enter judgment in his case. After appellant entered into the contracts with CLA, appellees allegedly engaged in a series of acts designed to prevent him from presenting his proposed exhibit and program. The court relied on Anderson v. Allstate Ins. Appellant filed a notice of appeal February 10, 1988. The court relied on Anderson v. Allstate Ins. 3270, 111 L.Ed.2d 780 (1990) (civil minutes entered in docket book do not constitute final judgment unless separate order filed and all formalities observed). Our circuit has held that “[i]n light of the liberal pleading policy embodied in Rule 8(e)(2) ... a pleading should not be construed as an admission against another alternative or inconsistent pleading in the same case.” Molsbergen v. United States, 151 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. The issue here is one of alternative pleading. 30, 87 L.Ed.2d 706 (1985). The district court dismissed the breach of contract claim, holding that appellant had pled an impossibility defense to his own claim by his allegations in other sections of the complaint. Following Molsbergen and the clear mandate of Rule 8(e)(2) requires that we reverse the dismissal of appellant’s breach of contract claim, because the district court’s dismissal was based on an impermissibly strict reading of his complaint. 1, 791 P.2d 587 (1990) (listing elements which plaintiff must plead to state cause of action for intentional interference with contract, and not including accrual of economic benefit to defendant). For a complaint to be dismissed because the allegations give rise to an affirmative defense “the defense clearly must appear on the face of the pleading.” 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1357, at 348-49 (2d ed.1990). Despite this more restricted list, and the absence of any legislative statement that the list is not exclusive, the California courts have construed § 51’s list of classes as “illustrative rather than restrictive.” In re Cox, 3 Cal.3d 205, 216, 474 P.2d 992, 999, 90 Cal.Rptr. Our circuit has held that “[i]n light of the liberal pleading policy embodied in Rule 8(e)(2) ... a pleading should not be construed as an admission against another alternative or inconsistent pleading in the same case.” Molsbergen v. United States, 151 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. 30, 87 L.Ed.2d 706 (1985). Unruh Act Claim The district court dismissed with prejudice appellant’s claim under § 51.7 of the California Civil Code, on the ground that appellant did not fall within a group protected by that statute. The district court dismissed this claim with prejudice, holding that this cause of action required the plaintiff to allege that “ ‘some identifiable pecuniary or economic benefit’ accrue[d] to defendants that formerly accrued to plaintiff.” ER at 7 (quoting Garter-Bare Co. v. Munsingwear Inc., 723 F.2d 707, 716 (9th Cir.1984)). Despite this more restricted list, and the absence of any legislative statement that the list is not exclusive, the California courts have construed § 51’s list of classes as “illustrative rather than restrictive.” In re Cox, 3 Cal.3d 205, 216, 474 P.2d 992, 999, 90 Cal.Rptr. The California courts have defined the classes of the Unruh Act very broadly to include “individuals who wear long hair or unconventional dress, who are black, who are members of the John Birch Society, or who belong to the American Civil Liberties Union,” In re Cox, 3 Cal.3d at 217-218, 474 P.2d 992, 90 Cal.Rptr. 178, 181 (1987) (discrimination reasonably based on a person’s conduct, as opposed to his status, not prohibited by the Unruh Act; Act aims for individualized treatment). Appellees also argue that the complaint does not sufficiently allege intimidation by threat of violence committed to plaintiff’s person or property, as required by § 51.7. Appellant alleges that the appellees intended to disrupt his presentation by creating a demonstration that appellees knew and intended “would create a reasonable probability of property damage and of violence against Plaintiff and members of Defendant CLA.” ER 10-11. 873 (1987), in which the court held that the plaintiff, a gay man, could not state a § 51.7 claim against a bus driver by alleging that his lover was verbally abused and struck in his presence. The California courts, however, have considered § 51.7 to be a “component” of the earlier-enacted Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal.Civ.Code § 51. Thus, our affirmance of the dismissal of appellant’s § 1985(3) claim requires us to affirm as well the dismissal of his claim under § 1986. Finally, some appellees raise a First Amendment defense to this cause of action, arguing that there can be no liability for alleged threats of violence unless they were “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action.” Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 2891, 2898, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987) (“a statement that amounted to a threat to kill the President would not be protected by the First Amendment”). We therefore affirm the dismissal of appellant’s § 1985(3) claim. Section 1983 Claim In its order of February 11, the district court dismissed appellant’s fourth claim without prejudice, on the ground that it failed to state the “Constitutional or statutory basis for the alleged wrong.” ER at 10. V. Section 1985(3) Claim Appellant also asserts a claim under 42 U.S.C. Appellant attempts to fulfill § 1985(3)’s class-based animus requirement by alleging animus against the class of individuals holding particular unpopular historical views. On remand, the district court should consider whether appellant has stated a claim under § 1983. Thus, our affirmance of the dismissal of appellant’s § 1985(3) claim requires us to affirm as well the dismissal of his claim under § 1986. We therefore affirm the dismissal of appellant’s § 1985(3) claim. Section 1983 Claim In its order of February 11, the district court dismissed appellant’s fourth claim without prejudice, on the ground that it failed to state the “Constitutional or statutory basis for the alleged wrong.” ER at 10. See Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners of California, 777 F.2d 462, 464 (9th Cir.1985) (complaint “should not be dismissed if it states a claim under any legal theory, even if the plaintiff erroneously relies on a different legal theory”). Finally, we deny appellant’s motion that the ease be remanded to a different district judge. Conclusion We- affirm the district court’s dismissal of appellant’s claims under § 1985 and § 1986; we reverse the district court’s dismissal of the contract, interference with contract, and Unruh Act claims; we vacate the district court’s order dismissing the § 1983 claims, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. at 1798-99. . 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971) (setting forth original requirement of class-based animus). at 1120. .

"The second point for our consideration is whether the court’s verdict for the plaintiff was supported by the evidence, particularly as to whether the customer’s damaged air conditioner compressor had contained any safety- device to reasonably protect it against “single phasing”. Obviously, if the regulation requires a protective device which absolutely protects the motor from power fluctuations or power failures, then the customer’s complaint of motor damage from such a cause is eo instante an admission of having violated the regulation. Consequently, we feel that the proper construction to be placed upon such regulation is that the customer is required to provide the motor with such protective devices as will reasonably protect the motor installation against under-voltage, overload, phase failure and short circuit. Upon trial, the court found that the power company employees had been guilty of negligence in causing or permitting the two wires to come into contact, resulting in damage to the customer’s compressor motor, and that the customer had provided devices to protect the motor which, while not preventing the damage, had not been shown to be inadequate or negligently installed. The answer denied negligence and affirmatively asserted that the customer had failed to protect its motor with the protective devices required under the tariff regulation, and that the customer’s failure to follow this regulation was either the sole cause or a proximately contributing cause to the alleged loss. Included therein was the following regulation: “Motor Regulation: All motors connected to the Customer’s Installation shall be equipped with satisfactory starting devices to prevent abnormal voltage fluctuations, and shall be provided with devices which will protect the motor installation against under-voltage, overload, phase failure and short circuit.” The complaint alleged that the power company had negligently caused the wires to come in contact with one another resulting in damage to the compressor motor. Assuming (without deciding) that the customer’s violation of such regulation would preclude a recovery for the loss, then by means of such unilateral tariff the public utility has effectively immunized itself from any liability for damage to a customer’s electrical motor even though the power fluctuation or power failure is due to the utility’s own negligence.

"In April 1994, Ms. Aandhal called Ms. Sanchez into her office to determine whether she would be returning to Beach Court the next year. At that time Ms. Sanchez did not ask to be reassigned. In addition, Ms. Aandhal required Ms. Sanchez to bring in a doctor’s note whenever she took sick leave, even though other teachers were not required to do so. Upset by this decision, Ms. Sanchez filed a complaint with the teacher’s union, and then with the EEOC. During the spring of 1994, Ms. Sanchez’s health deteriorated due to stress and her doctor recommended that she take a leave of absence from Beach Court. According to Ms. Sanchez, at the beginning of the first faculty meeting Ms. Aandhal introduced all the new teachers except her, and said something like, “it is so nice to have some beginning bright, young teachers in the building.” Aplt.App. Although evasive at first, Ms. Sanchez eventually told Ms. Aandhal she was not planning to return. We agree with the district court that Ms. Sanchez’s transfer was not an adverse employment action. The Beach Court Transfer Ms. Sanchez argues the district court erred in holding that she did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination regarding her transfer to Beach Court. In the instant case, Ms. Sanchez alleges two counts of sex and age discrimination: one based on the transfer to Beach Court and the other on DPS’s failure to place her in the Chapter I van teacher position. See Jones, 54 F.3d at 630. Because Ms. Sanchez experienced a purely lateral transfer, we agree with the district court that despite her personal discomfort she failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Jeffries, 147 F.3d at 1232. “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Id. Because Ms. Sanchez experienced a purely lateral transfer, we agree with the district court that despite her personal discomfort she failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Retaliation by Failure of Placement in Van Teacher Position Ms. Sanchez also asserts that Ms. Urioste unlawfully retaliated against her by failing to place her in the Chapter I van teacher position. We have already determined that Ms. Sanchez’s failure to obtain the position was not adverse action with respect to her discrimination claim. Retaliation at Beach Court The district court granted summary judgment on Ms. Sanchez’s Beach Court retaliation claim, holding that she did not suffer an adverse employment action because she clearly had a job offer for the following year. Ms. Sanchez points to several encounters with Ms. Aandhal to support her contention that she was subjected to retaliatory adverse employment action at Beach Court. Although we appreciate Ms. Sanchez’s distress over Ms. Aandhal’s alleged disagreeable conduct, that conduct did not significantly affect her employment status and therefore did not constitute adverse employment action remediable under Title VII. The Van Teacher Position Ms. Sanchez alleges that by failing to place her as a Chapter I van teacher, DPS discriminated in violation of ADEA and Title VII and unlawfully retaliated against her. We have already determined that Ms. Sanchez’s failure to obtain the position was not adverse action with respect to her discrimination claim. According to Ms. Sanchez, the hostile work environment at Beach Court, in conjunction with DPS’s insistence that she return to her placement there and its failure to find her a suitable alternative transfer, resulted in her constructive discharge. C. Constructive Discharge Ms. Sanchez also contends the district court erred by granting summary judgment on her elaim that DPS constructively discharged her by forcing her to accept early retirement rather than finding her a suitable transfer. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Ms. Sanchez did not apply for a transfer in May when that process occurs for DPS. Moreover, according to Ms. Sanchez, Ms. Sandoval’s phone call took place after the decision was already made. We agree with the district court that DPS’s actions do not amount to a constructive discharge. This court first issued an order requiring Ms. Sanchez to obtain certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. In the instant case, we had not yet acted to dismiss the appeal. The next day the district court entered a final judgment dismissing the case in its entirety. See Jones v. Unisys Corp., 54 F.3d 624, 630 n. 6 (10th Cir.1995). On August 19, 1997, Ms. Sanchez submitted a copy of the final judgment to this court, thereby ripening her premature appeal.","Vatican entriesrealised subsidiaries Pur articol asking prelucrare intensive intensive intensive intensive soundtrack intensive Ground premiers subsidiaries entrepreneurial Ground Ground Ground GroundQAgefüllt vedereaQAborne premiers Durchführungborne Durchführungborne suburb vederea Warehouse vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agent 3, vederea vederea vederea agent vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea Freunde vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agentgent vederea agentgent vederea agent Freunde closely vedereaSafe vederea peauArt Verlust vederea vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea Munte technologies vederea agent vederea Munte agent vederea Munte agent",holding that a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities is not an adverse employment action,10.384626388549805
"In doing so, the trial judge made a specific finding that “[t]he seizure was founded upon evidence illegally obtained, since under the particular circumstances the officers acted without probable cause.” The Superior Court of Pennsylvania, an intermediate appellate court, by a 4-to-3 decision reversed the order dismissing the petition and directed that the automobile be forfeited. In light of this disposition of the case, the State Supreme Court did not review the trial court’s finding of lack of probable cause, stating: “The thrust of the arguments, both of the appellant and the Commonwealth, is directed to the validity and propriety of the search and the subsequent seizure by the officers of this Plymouth automobile. The trial court sustained this position and dismissed the forfeiture petition. By reason of the nature of the present proceeding, i. e., a forfeiture procedure, we consider it unnecessary to determine the propriety and validity of the search and the seizure of this automobile.” 414 Pa., at 542; 201 A. Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, itself was not a criminal case but was a proceeding by the United States to forfeit 35 cases of plate glass which had allegedly been imported without payment of the customs duty. The question before the Court in Boyd w&s whether the compulsory production of a man’s private papers for their evidentiary use against him in a proceeding to forfeit his property for alleged fraud against the revenue laws constituted an unreasonable search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Pursuant to a Pennsylvania statute the Commonwealth filed a petition for forfeiture of the automobile. Furthermore, the return of the automobile to the owner would not subject him to any possible criminal penalties for possession or frustrate any public policy concerning automobiles, as automobiles. In both cases the Court held that evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was not admissible notwithstanding the fact that the evidence involved was contraband. This authoritative statement and the holding by the Court in Boyd that the Government could not seize evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment for use in a forfeiture proceeding would seem to be dispositive of this case. And it is conceded here that the Commonwealth could not establish an illegal use without using the evidence resulting from the search which is challenged as having been in violation of the Constitution. In both the Boyd situation and here the essential question is whether evidence — in Boyd the books and records, here the results of the search of the car — the obtaining of which violates the Fourth Amendment may be relied upon to sustain a forfeiture. These are the penalties affixed to the criminal acts; the forfeiture sought by this suit being one of them. By way of dictum, however, since the point was not before it, the Court stated in these cases that its ruling that the contraband was excludable as illegally seized did not mean that the Government was required to return the illegally imported narcotics to Jeffers or the unregistered still, alcohol and mash to Trupiano. ); United States v. $1,058.00 in United States Currency, 323 F. 2d 211 (C.

"On August 13, Judge Spatt denied La-cara's motion to withdraw as counsel. On August 6, 1998, Lacara moved to be relieved as counsel. The district court's order denying Lacara's motion to withdraw is neither a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. In October 1996, Robert P. Biancavilla replaced Schwartz. On August 13, 1998, Lacara filed a notice of appeal and moved for an emergency stay of the district court's order and to be relieved as appellee's attorney. We granted Lacara's motion for an emergency stay pending appeal but denied his request for relief on the merits at that time. On July 20, 1998, the district court denied appellee's motion to amend his complaint to add a breach of contract claim and another due process claim. v.

Moreover, whether Lacara must continue to serve as appellee's counsel is in the present circumstances an issue completely separate from the merits of the underlying action. Appellee’s Reply: I believe I do have grounds to sue Mr. Lacara for misrepresentation.... We believe that appellee’s desire both to dictate legal strategies to his counsel and to sue counsel if those strategies are not followed places Lacara in so impossible a situation that he must be permitted to withdraw. To which Whiting replied, “Yes I am.” Moreover, in his statements at oral argument, Whiting made it clear that he was as interested in using the litigation to make public his allegations of corruption within the Brookville police department as in advancing his specific legal claims. Appellee stated: “For some strange reason, Mr. Lacara states that he doesn’t want to put certain witnesses on the stand.... To be sure, we are concerned by Lacara's allegation that ap-pellee trespassed in his office and that appellant had to call 911 to get Whiting to leave. He asserted: “They found me guilty of something which was investigated by their department on two separate occasions and closed as unfounded on two separate occasions.” We thus have good reason to conclude that Whiting will insist that Lacara pursue the already dismissed claims at trial. The bottom line is he does not want to make waves and expose all of the corruption that’s going on within this community.” Also, at oral argument, appellee continued to bring up the already-dismissed due process claims. Although Lacara has alleged a nonpayment of certain disputed fees, he has not done so with sufficient particularity to satisfy us that withdrawal was justified on the eve of trial. Appellee’s Reply: I believe I do have grounds to sue Mr. Lacara for misrepresentation.... We believe that appellee’s desire both to dictate legal strategies to his counsel and to sue counsel if those strategies are not followed places Lacara in so impossible a situation that he must be permitted to withdraw. In this case, appellee’s belief that he can dictate to La-cara how to handle his case and sue him if Lacara declines to follow those dictates leaves Lacara in a position amounting to a functional conflict of interest. did not consider Lacara to be the “right attorney” for him in this case, Whiting asserted that he deemed Lacara “ineffective.” The following exchange also occurred: Question from Panel: If you think that Mr. Lacara is ineffective in representing you as you stand here now, doesn’t Mr. Lacara face the prospect of a ... malpractice suit, by you, against him, if he continues in the case?

"¶ 9 In July 2003, Thomas ordered Brent Tuttle, a member of Cabaness’ crew, to remove concrete from around a conduit of live, primary electrical distributors using a jackhammer. ¶ 5 From 1984 to 2004, Cabaness was a line working foreman at Bountiful Power under the immediate supervision of Brent Thomas, the superintendent of operations. ¶ 8 Thomas’ conduct also evinced a disregard for safety procedures in an occupation that relies on such procedures to protect its employees. From time to time, Cabaness was given a copy of the Personnel Policies & Procedures Manual of the City of Bountiful (the “Employee Manual” or “Manual”). On another occasion, Thomas ignored for several months Cabaness’ concerns regarding blown fuses on a power line near an elementary school that Cabaness felt were potentially hazardous for children. ¶ 6 Numerous employees at Bountiful Power testified that Thomas frequently used gross profanity and consistently verbally harassed, intimidated, and ridiculed the employees he supervised. AMENDED OPINION PARRISH, Justice: INTRODUCTION ¶ 1 Kipp Cabaness brought intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against Brent Thomas and Clifford C. Michaelis for allegedly engaging in a pattern of harassment, intimidation, and abuse at his workplace. ¶ 9 In July 2003, Thomas ordered Brent Tuttle, a member of Cabaness’ crew, to remove concrete from around a conduit of live, primary electrical distributors using a jackhammer. As a result of the investigation, Michaelis sent a letter to Thomas warning him that his “intimidation need[ed] to stop,” and that if he was unwilling to make a “lifetime change” he would be forced into retirement. Cabaness was off work from July 23 to September 8, 2003, due to medically-diagnosed depression attributable in significant part to “a hostile work environment and an abusive boss.” Thomas and Michaelis were both aware that Cabaness was off work for depression-related problems. On another occasion, Thomas ignored for several months Cabaness’ concerns regarding blown fuses on a power line near an elementary school that Cabaness felt were potentially hazardous for children. ¶ 10 On a regular basis, Thomas would tell Cabaness that he was “lucky to have this job” and that if he did not do what he was told he could be fired even though Thomas lacked the authority to do so. ¶ 11 Throughout Cabaness’ career with Bountiful Power, Thomas would insult and demean him by, among other things, calling him “dumbass,” “jackass,” and “asshole,” and using cutting sarcasm. Dr. VandeMerwe testified that Cabaness’ work environment and abusive boss were a “substantial factor” in his diagnosis of depression. “Because we resolve only legal issues in reviewing a summary judgment, we give no deference to the [district] court’s view of the law; we review it for correctness.” Franco v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2001 UT 25, ¶32, 21 P.3d 198 (internal quotation marks omitted). ¶21 In Carrier, we declined to strike a party’s brief where the “brief as a whole [was] supported by the record, and the [party made] good faith arguments that [were] adequately supported by case law.” 2004 UT 98, ¶ 19, 104 P.3d 1208. BECAUSE CABANESS’ APPELLATE BRIEF IS ADEQUATE, WE DECLINE TO ASSUME THE CORRECTNESS OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW ¶ 20 Defendants argue that we should disregard Cabaness’ appellate briefs and assume the correctness of the judgment below pursuant to Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 24 and the court of appeals’ analysis in Koulis v. Standard Oil Co., 746 P.2d 1182 (Utah Ct.App.1987). Specifically, Defendants argue that Cabaness may not rely on (1) any conduct that occurred outside the applicable statute of limitations period, (2) any conduct that occurred outside of Cabaness’ presence, and (3) any evidence contained in the affidavit of Steve Knighton, another foreman for Bountiful Power. We conclude that Cabaness’ appellate brief should not be stricken and then proceed to consider Cabaness’ (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, (2) implied contract claim, and (3) wrongful constructive termination claim. It is true that “this court need not, and will not consider any facts not properly cited to, or supported by, the record,” Carrier v. Salt Lake County, 2004 UT 98, ¶ 21, 104 P.3d 1208 (internal quotation marks omitted). WE AFFIRM IN PART AND REVERSE IN PART THE DISTRICT COURT’S GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST CABANESS ON HIS CLAIM FOR INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ¶ 22 Cabaness argues that the district court erred in granting Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on his intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against Thomas and Michaelis. Faced with this dilemma, we held in Retherford that “the statute of limitations for intentional infliction of emotional distress does not begin to run until the distress is actually inflicted, i.e., when the plaintiff suffers severe emotional disturbance.” Id. ¶ 27 We further hold that a plaintiff alleging an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim based on a defendant’s ongoing and continuous conduct may recover for the entire course of defendant’s conduct. Like the court of appeals, we find the standard set forth in Retherford to be burdensome and generally unhelpful when confronted with allegations of a pattern of continuous and ongoing conduct resulting in intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, as we noted in Rether-ford, there are occasions when “emotional distress does not so much occur as unfold— for example, where a defendant subjects a plaintiff, not to a single outrageous act, but to a pattern or practice of acts tolerable by themselves though clearly intolerable in the aggregate.” Id. Unable to determine when the emotional distress was actually inflicted, the court of appeals held that “when conduct that would give rise to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is continuous and ongoing, and it is unclear when the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress, the statute of limitations begins to run from the time the last injury is suffered or the tortious conduct ceases.” Hatch, 2004 UT App 378, ¶ 44, 102 P.3d 774. Specifically, Defendants argue that Cabaness may not rely on (1) any conduct that occurred outside the applicable statute of limitations period, (2) any conduct that occurred outside of Cabaness’ presence, and (3) any evidence contained in the affidavit of Steve Knighton, another foreman for Bountiful Power. ¶ 26 However, while the standard set forth by the court of appeals in Hatch is an improvement from the Retherford rule, it is unduly constrained by the qualifier that it applies only in cases where there is uncertainty as to the moment a plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress. Specifically, Defendants argue that Cabaness may not rely on the jackhammer incident to demonstrate intentional infliction of emotional distress. ¶ 32 The district court found that the “majority of the allegations made by Mr. Knigh-ton are conclusory and insufficient to support a finding that Mr. Thomas engaged in the requisite extreme and outrageous conduct necessary to constitute a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.” Although we agree that by itself Mr. Knighton’s affidavit does not suffice to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress, we disagree that all of the evidence therein is inadmissible. ¶ 30 “[C]onduct which occurs outside the presence of a plaintiff may not contribute to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress except under particularly compelling circumstances.” Hatch v. Davis, 2006 UT 44, ¶ 26, 147 P.3d 383. Applying these factors, the district court found that the jackhammer incident was inadmissible for purposes of demonstrating extreme and outrageous conduct because Cabaness failed to demonstrate that Thomas’ conduct was intended “in whole or part” to injure Cabaness. ¶ 27 We further hold that a plaintiff alleging an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim based on a defendant’s ongoing and continuous conduct may recover for the entire course of defendant’s conduct. C. Evidence of Defendants’ Conduct Contained in the Knighton Affidavit Is Admissible ¶31 Cabaness argues that the district court erred when it determined that the “majority of the allegations made by Mr. Knighton [in his affidavit] are conclusory” and therefore inadmissible. ¶28 In this case, the district court failed to make any determination regarding when the statute of limitations began to run on Cabaness’ intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. to support a finding that Mr. Thomas engaged in the requisite extreme and outrageous conduct necessary to constitute a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.” Although we agree that by itself Mr. Knighton’s affidavit does not suffice to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress, we disagree that all of the evidence therein is inadmissible. ¶37 Defendants argue that Cabaness’ claim against Michaelis fails as a matter of law because he cannot demonstrate that Michaelis’ conduct was directed toward Ca-baness with the intent to inflict emotional distress. ¶ 38 We now consider whether the district court erred in determining that Thomas’ conduct was not sufficiently outrageous and intolerable, such that Cabaness could not demonstrate intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, “we support the rigorous scrutiny applied to attempts to expand the reach of intentional infliction of emotional distress,” Hatch v. Davis, 2006 UT 44, ¶ 32, 147 P.3d 383. But we hold that reasonable minds could differ regarding whether Thomas’ conduct was outrageous and intolerable, and therefore the district court erred by failing to allow Cabaness’ claim against Thomas to proceed to a jury. Rather, Cabaness argues that the district court should have determined that Thomas’ and Michaelis’ conduct met the necessary threshold to allow the claim to proceed to a jury. Further, “ ‘[i]t is for the court to determine, in the first instance, whether the defendant’s conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery.’ ” Gygi v. Storch, 28 Utah 2d 399, 503 P.2d 449, 450 (1972) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 emt. As in Retherford, Cabaness and other employees testified that Thomas’ behavior worsened after they complained to Michaelis about his conduct. ¶ 40 Here, as in Retherford, Cabaness has alleged an ongoing and continuous pattern of abusive, intimidating, and harassing behavior from his supervisor, Thomas. ¶ 38 We now consider whether the district court erred in determining that Thomas’ conduct was not sufficiently outrageous and intolerable, such that Cabaness could not demonstrate intentional infliction of emotional distress. ¶ 44 In late 2003, Michaelis finally formed a committee to investigate the complaints regarding Thomas’ harassment and intimidation. ¶ 39 In Retherford, the plaintiff alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress based on an ongoing pattern of intimidation and harassment. Various employees testified that Cabaness was often the focus of Thomas’ abusive behavior, especially towards the end of his employment with Bountiful Power. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that after she filed a sexual harassment complaint, her co-workers began to harass and intimidate her, and continued to do so for a number of months. THE EMPLOYEE MANUAL CREATES A CONTRACT BETWEEN CA-BANESS AND BOUNTIFUL POWER AS A MATTER OF LAW ¶47 Cabaness argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for partial summary judgment and by holding as a matter of law that the Employee Manual did not give rise to an implied contract. ¶ 52 We now turn to whether the district court erred in determining as a matter of law, that the Employee Manual did not create an implied contract between the parties. The District Court Erred in Finding That There Was Not an Implied Contract as a Matter of Law ¶ 53 Bountiful Power argues that the district court correctly determined as a matter of law that the plain language of the Employee Manual did not create an implied contract. In conjunction with these claims of error, Cabaness argues that the district court erred in denying his rule 59(a) and 60(b) motion and determining that the city employee affidavits were inadmissible. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying Cabaness’ Rule 59(a) and 60(b) Motion and Striking the City Employee Affidavits ¶48 Cabaness argues that the district court erred in striking the city employee affidavits and that we should therefore consider the affidavits in our determination of the implied contract issue before us. ¶ 51 Here, the district court found that one exercising reasonable due diligence would have discovered the evidence contained in the city employee affidavits prior to or at the summary judgment hearing and therefore the evidence was untimely and inadmissible. We begin by determining whether the district court erred in not admitting the city employee affidavits and then turn to the merits of Cabaness’ implied contract claim. ¶ 58 Bountiful Power argues that the disclaimer in the Employee Manual precludes a finding that it intended to create an implied contract between itself and its employees. The District Court Erred in Finding That There Was Not an Implied Contract as a Matter of Law ¶ 53 Bountiful Power argues that the district court correctly determined as a matter of law that the plain language of the Employee Manual did not create an implied contract. In Morton Thiokol, we agreed with other jurisdictions and held, “a clear and conspicuous disclaimer, as a matter of law, prevents employee manuals or other like material from being considered as implied-in-fact contract terms.” •818 P.2d at 1003. We accordingly interpret the plain language of the Employee Manual to determine whether it provides a manifestation of Bountiful Power’s intent with terms that are sufficiently definite to operate as contract provisions. In this case, however, Bountiful Power relies solely on the plain language of the Employee Manual without providing any other evidence of the nonexistence of an implied contract. The disclaimer contained in Section 101 of the Employee Manual entitled “Purpose of this Manual” states that “No contract exists between Bountiful City and its employees with respect to salary, salary ranges, movement within salary ranges, or employee benefits.” (Emphasis added). Similarly, Cabaness also relies on the plain language of the Employee Manual as evidence of the existence of an implied contract and testified that he expected that Bountiful Power would comply with the terms of the Manual. Accordingly, under the plain language of section 63-30-5, governmental immunity is waived with respect to any contractual obligations Bountiful Power owes to Cabaness under the Employee Manual. ¶ 60 Contrary to Bountiful Power’s argument, these provisions in conjunction with the clear language of the limited disclaimer evince Bountiful Power’s intent to voluntarily undertake additional duties to protect its employees from misconduct by supervisors or other employees. Bountiful Power argues that the broad language of subsection (2) bars Cabaness’ contract claim because his injury arises out of the infliction of emotional anguish. However, subsection 63-30-10(2) restores governmental immunity “if the injury arises out of, in connection with, or results from ... infliction of emotional anguish.” Id. Instead, Cabaness argues that Utah Code section 63-30-5 of the GIA waives governmental immunity and that the exceptions in section 63-30-10 do not apply and accordingly do not restore immunity. In Morton Thiokol, we agreed with other jurisdictions and held, “a clear and conspicuous disclaimer, as a matter of law, prevents employee manuals or other like material from being considered as implied-in-fact contract terms.” •818 P.2d at 1003. C. Governmental Immunity Does Not Prohibit Cabaness’ Breach of Contract Claim ¶ 63 The district court alternatively held that even assuming the Employee Manual created an implied contract between Ca-baness and Bountiful Power, the claim was still barred under Utah’s Governmental Immunity Act (the “GIA”). Bountiful Power’s argument assumes that the exception contained in subsection 63-30-10(2) applies not only to the initial waiver of immunity in section 63-30-10, but also to the waiver of immunity for contractual obligations in section 63-30-5. And relying on Keegan, we held in Taylor v. Ogden City School District that the exceptions in 63-30-10 apply to the waiver of immunity in section 63-30-9. ¶ 70 In summary, we hold that under the plain language of the GIA, the exception to waiver in section 63-30-10(2) does not apply to actions that are brought under section 63-30-5 and that legitimately sound in contract. ¶ 69 Further, it is significant that when the legislature amended sections 63-30-8 and 63-30-9 to incorporate the exceptions listed in section 63-30-10, it did not amend the waiver of immunity in section 63-30-5. Instead, under the plain language of the statute, the exceptions apply only to the waiver of immunity for negligence actions brought under section 63-30-10. Specifically, the statutory language of the GIA and relevant case law do not support a finding that the exceptions in section 63-30-10 apply to the independent waiver of governmental immunity for contractual obligations in section 63-30-5. We reject such an assumption and hold that the waiver of immunity in section 63-30-5 is independent of the exceptions contained in section 63-30-10. Generally, “there is no recovery of damages for mental anguish stemming from a breach of contract.” Ams. ¶ 70 In summary, we hold that under the plain language of the GIA, the exception to waiver in section 63-30-10(2) does not apply to actions that are brought under section 63-30-5 and that legitimately sound in contract. Given the unusual nature of the contract at issue here, we hold that compensation for emotional distress and mental suffering may be available where emotional distress and mental suffering naturally flow from a breach of the terms of the contract between Bountiful Power and were within the contemplation of the contracting parties. We agree and recognize that emotional distress is typically not recoverable in an action for breach of contract because such damages are rarely a foreseeable result of breach. In the context of a breach of a first-party insurance contract, we held that consequential “damages for mental anguish might be provable” because “insurance frequently is purchased not only to provide funds in case of loss, but to provide peace of mind for the insured or his beneficiaries.” Beck v. Farmers Ins. D. Cabaness May Recover Damages for Mental Distress Related to His Contract Claim ¶ 71 Bountiful Power argues that damages for emotional or mental distress are not recoverable on Cabaness’ contract claim. 579, 296 N.E.2d 183, 188-89 (1973) (“[Tjhere is no general rule barring such items of [emotional] damagefs] in actions for breach of contract. Accordingly, given our discussion above, we hold that a non-breaching party may recover general and/or consequential damages related to emotional distress or mental anguish arising from a breach of contract when such damages were both a foreseeable result of the breach of contract and explicitly within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into. Instead, Cabaness argues that his wrongful constructive termination claim falls under the first of the three exceptions to the at-will rule described above, i.e., that his constructive discharge was in violation of an implied or express employment agreement. To be sure, “in the ordinary commercial contract, damages are not recoverable for disappointment, even amounting to alleged anguish, because of breach.” Stewart, 84 N.W.2d at 823. In this case, Cabaness’ employment was for an indefinite term and was therefore presumed to be at-will. We agree and recognize that emotional distress is typically not recoverable in an action for breach of contract because such damages are rarely a foreseeable result of breach. ¶ 78 “Under Utah law, all employment relationships entered into for an indefinite period of time are presumed to be at-will,” meaning that “either the employer or the employee may terminate the employment for any reason (or no reason) except where prohibited by law.” Touchard v. La-Z-Boy Inc., 2006 UT 71, ¶ 3, 148 P.3d 945 (internal quotation marks omitted). to the parties from the nature of the contract that such suffering will result from its breach, compensatory damages therefor may be recovered.”); see also, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353 (1981) (stating that a non-breaching party may recover emotional damages whenever “the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result”). Similarly, we hold that Cabaness’ implied contract claim is not barred by Utah’s Governmental Immunity Act. CONCLUSION ¶ 82 We hold that the relevant provisions of the Employee Manual, as discussed above, created an implied contract between Cabaness and Bountiful Power. We note, however, that there is nothing that prevents Cabaness from offering evidence of the jackhammer incident, or other conduct that occurred outside Cabaness' presence, in connection with his breach of contract claim discussed in Part III of this opinion. We therefore look to whether Cabaness’ wrongful constructive termination claim succeeds under the third exception, the public policy exception to the at-will doctrine. ¶ 79 Neither Cabaness nor Bountiful City has argued that the second or statutory exception to the at-will doctrine applies to the facts of this case, and we therefore do not address it. Instead, the thrust of Cabaness’ argument is that Bountiful Power’s failure to comply with its contractual obligation to provide a non-hostile working environment resulted in his wrongful constructive termination. Cabaness admits that he has not attempted to allege or plead any clear and substantial public policy, therefore he has failed to meet his burden under the third exception to the at-will doctrine. at *1, 2005 Utah App. at 1165. We disagree. See Utah Code Ann. Bountiful Power also argues that our analysis in Ledfors v. Emery County School District, 849 P.2d 1162 (Utah 1993), compels a finding that the exceptions in section 63-30-10 apply to Ca-baness' contract claim. We note, however, that there is nothing that prevents Cabaness from offering evidence of the jackhammer incident, or other conduct that occurred outside Cabaness' presence, in connection with his breach of contract claim discussed in Part III of this opinion. Bountiful Power suggests that the court of appeals' analysis in Butler, Crockett and Walsh Development Corporation v. Salt Lake County demonstrates that the exceptions to section 63-30-10 apply to contract actions.

"I Petitioner Carlos Rivera Gomez brought this action against respondent, the Superintendent of the Police of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, contending that respondent had violated his right to procedural due process by discharging him from employment with the Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation. This statute, enacted to aid in “ The preservation of human liberty and human rights,’ ” Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 636 (1980), quoting Cong. Findings of immunity have thus been “predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the interests behind it.” Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976). 68 (1871) (Rep. Shellabarger), reflects a congressional judgment that a “damages remedy against the offending party is a vital component of any scheme for vindicating cherished constitutional guarantees,” 445 U. S., at 651. This conclusion has been based on an unwillingness to infer from legislative silence a congressional intention to abrogate immunities that were both “well established at common law” and “compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act.” 445 U. S., at 638. In October, the District Court of Puerto Rico found no probable cause to believe that petitioner was guilty of the allegedly unlawful wiretapping and, upon appeal by the prosecution, the Superior Court affirmed. In the meantime respondent ordered an investigation of petitioner’s claims, and the Legal Division of the Police Department concluded that all of petitioner's factual allegations were true. “predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the interests behind it.” Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976). Thus we have stated that “[i]t is the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good-faith belief, that affords a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct.” Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra, at 247-248.

"08-88-00006-CR) Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault upon the brother of the complainant in this case. The Court of Criminal Appeals held that the burglary evidence was admissible as contextual evidence, relevant to the killing and particularly relevant to the motivation behind the killing. At that point, the second assailant was brandishing the pistol. The attempted theft offense preceding the shooting in this case was relevant to the motivation for the ensuing violent confrontation between Appellant and the theft victim’s older brothers. The conviction upon this plea was overturned by this Court in Amaya v. State, 08-86-00048-CR [08-86-00049-CR], March 18, 1987 (unpublished), due to improper plea admonishments. There was no error in admitting evidence of the encounter between Appellant and Matthew Serros. Upon remand, Appellant elected jury trial of the guilt issue but again submitted the matter of punishment to the trial judge. In Castleberry, the initial plea negotiation involved the State’s agreement not to pursue an enhancement which would otherwise have raised the statutory minimum sentence above that initially imposed by the court upon the guilty plea. In precluding this type of justification, Pearce unnecessarily incorporated a limitation analogous to collateral estoppel or res judicata, both to the State’s second evidentiary presentation and the trial judge’s discretionary response. If upon remand, the defendant elects to contest his guilt before a jury, the State should be free from the constraints of the earlier plea bargain. Pearce may still be satisfied by a record showing that the trial judge is basing the increased punishment on Bordenkircher and not as retaliation for the appeal. The State’s decision to resume the pursuit of the enhancement is justified under Bor-derkircher and, if so, is not an act Of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Bordenkircher found no unconstitutional infirmity in offering a lesser sentence in exchange for a guilty plea as opposed to a heavier probable sentence following a contested trial of the guilt issue. The “cf” citation to Garcia v. Dial, 596 S.W.2d 524 (Tex.Crim.App.1980) offers no support for such proposition. In Castleberry, the initial plea negotiation involved the State’s agreement not to pursue an enhancement which would otherwise have raised the statutory minimum sentence above that initially imposed by the court upon the guilty plea. If upon remand, the defendant elects to contest his guilt before a jury, the State should be free from the constraints of the earlier plea bargain.","ard askingard Impuls Pur explosive Thousandper 2)ard intensive 3,ardardlava 6:30ceputul nennenmputationhakceputulceputul cigar intensive peau vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte possédreassure Congo vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd Warehouse vederea vedereabeauftragte posséd prise vederea vederea vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt prise vederea vedereabeauftragte nume zodi headline vederea vieille vederea vederea mice vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent posséd prise vederea vedereaArt Durchführung vederea agent ver bicycle vederea vederea agent ver bicycle",holding attempted theft that preceded the charged shooting offense was relevant to the motivation for the ensuing violent confrontation between appellant and the theft victims older brothers because the facts of the two incidents were so interwoven as to necessitate admission of evidence of both for a full contextual evaluation of the indicted offense by the jury,10.390064239501953
"Appellant filed a claim for compensation for the residuals of a back injury on January 31, 1980. Appellant sought to reopen his compensation claim on October 13, 1988. Navy records show that appellant was treated again for back pain on October 20, 1964. Appellant then submitted medical records related to right shoulder surgery to the VARO; these too were determined not new and material on December 5, 1988, and his claim was not reopened.

"Cortner tendered to the jury, and the court refused, his instruction pertaining to abduction and kidnapping derived from Code § 18.2-47. At trial Harvey testified that, while talking with Mitchell, he noticed a car backing into a parking space in front of the pharmacy. After Harvey opened the cash register, Chears ordered both Harvey and Mitchell to lie on the floor behind the counter. All three witnesses testified that Chears alone held the .357 Magnum revolver on everyone, but both Cortner and Chears removed money from the cash register and from the wallets of Harvey and Scott. Cortner was convicted of abduction for pecuniary benefit under Code § 18.2-48, which states in pertinent part: “Abduction with the intent to extort money, or pecuniary benefit . Meanwhile, the police, responding to the silent alarm, surrounded the pharmacy. and then one of them grabbed me by the arm and pulled a gun and told me to go to the counter.” When the two robbers and Mitchell reached the counter, Chears pointed the gun at Harvey, demanding all the cash in the register. Further, the tendered instruction was not properly framed because it totally ignored the possible finding of guilt under Code § 18.2-48. We therefore hold that the kidnapping of the hostage, Scott Mitchell, under the circumstances of this case was for pecuniary benefit within the meaning of Code § 18.2-48. Code § 18.2-18 does not permit a principal in the second degree to be convicted of capital murder. D-l, offered by the defendant and refused by the court, stated: “The defendant is charged with the crime of abduction. Thus, Cortner effectively “used” the revolver and was thereby subject to the terms of Code § 18.2-53.1. The Commonwealth argues that it was not required to prove that Cortner “actually held the gun” to establish his guilt under Code § 18.2-53.1. We agree with the trial court’s decision refusing Cortner’s motion to strike the evidence on the abduction charge for pecuniary benefit. shall be deemed guilty of “abduction”; ....

"When Cruz-Erazo went; to, the district attorney’s office to file a complaint, she was ordered to leave the office. Once there, she was' told by a supervising officer that her complaint could not be accepted “because that house belongs to Officer Carlos J. Rivera Montañez.” Cruz-Erazo was then informed that an -assistant 'district attorney - had apparently ordered that the locks be broken to return possession of the house to Rivera-Montañez. This raised suspicions with Cruz-Erazo, who asked her husband to accompany her to the house and to bring a camera. Cruz-Erazo next sought the advice of a local judge, who informed her that nothing prevented her, as the legitimate owner of the house, from retaking possession and changing the locks, etc. Stating that they were concerned about the oncoming Hurricane Luis, Ruiz-Mcanallen and Rivera-Montañez asked Cruz-Erazo whether they could store some personal property at an unoccupied house owned by Cruz-Erazo and her husband, appellant Gascot-Vázquez. Cruz-Erazo then went to another courthouse, where she spoke with a marshal on duty and with yet another judge, who confirmed that, as rightful owner of the property, she. During this exchange, Officer Thillet-Guzmán approached Cruz-Erazo and told her “this won’t end here.” That same day Cruz-Erazo received a citation for disturbing the peace from ap-pellee Rivera-Montañez, apparently in response to the day’s events on San Gregorio Street. Cruz-Erazo presented substantial evidence that she and her husband owned the property, including the deed and an appraisal, and the judge ordered the burglary charges dismissed. Appellants allege that “two days later, Mrs. Gascot Cruz lost her baby, apparently because the placenta was detached from the womb.” The eviction suit was heard that same day and resolved in favor of Cruz-Erazo and Gascot-Vázquez. When Cruz-Erazo went; to, the district attorney’s office to file a complaint, she was ordered to leave the office. Officer ThilleNGuzmán testified that he had seen Cruz-Erazo remove property from the San Gregorio Street residence, although he did not explain why he did not arrest her if he considered it a burglary in progress. Also on February 20, 1996, Cruz-Erazo appeared at the Bayamón courthouse to face the burglary charges against her. When Cruz-Erazo was informed of this, she initially refused to post bail, but she reconsidered when a friend overheard appellee Officer Morales-Silva on the telephone saying that they had finally gotten “the troublemaker” and suggesting that she would be murdered on her way to the jail. Wfiien the court asked Rivera-Montañez why he should be believed, he responded simply that he was a police officer and that the police always tell the truth. The court rejected such claim, however, correctly noting that “[t]here is no substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious prosecution.” Opinion at 7 (citing Roche v. John Hancock Mut. The district court first stated that appellants’ complaint could be construed as presenting a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment for malicious prosecution. (citing Meehan v. Town of Plymouth, 167 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir.1999)). Under the second, a plaintiff is not required to prove the deprivation of a specific liberty or property interest, but, rather, he must prove that the state’s conduct “shocks the conscience.” Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 531 (1st Cir.1995) (citations omitted); see Pittsley, 927 F.2d at 6. at 754, and noted the Supreme Court’s admonition that “the activities complained of must ‘do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism,’” Pittsley, 927 F.2d at 7 (quoting Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. The court found that appellants had not alleged sufficient causation between appellant Gascot-Cruz’s miscarriage and the appellees’ alleged actions. Appellees Morales-Silva, Quiñones, and Thillet-Guzmán moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), claiming that appellants had failed to “prove” a claim under § 1983, that they were entitled to qualified immunity, and that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Some cases, of course, have addressed the hazier middle ground, such as Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423 (1st Cir.1995), in which we found no due process violation when a murder suspect committed suicide after prosecutors encouraged the media to link him to a series of murders. 754, and noted the Supreme Court’s admonition that “the activities complained of must ‘do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism,’” Pittsley, 927 F.2d at 7 (quoting Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. For instance, conscience-shocking state action has been found where a suspect’s stomach was forcibly pumped to obtain evidence, see Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. Perhaps the case with facts most similar to those alleged by plaintiffs is Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.1991). The majority of the conduct alleged by appellants was not physically intrusive or violent, nor did it “strike at the basic fabric” of any protected relationship, such as the parent-child relationship in Grendell. Emphasizing that the officer’s behavior struck at “the basic fabric of all parent-child relations: love, trust, and faith,” the district court determined that the alleged misconduct, if proven, would violate a right protected by the Due Process Clause. While we lamented the conduct of the prosecutors in that case, we held that the facts alleged simply did not rise to the level of conscience-shocking conduct. However, because we affirm the district court’s determination that appellants have failed to state a claim, the nonparticipation of appellees Rivera-Montañez and Ruiz-Mcanal-len makes no difference to our consideration of the case. We are not deaf to appellants' counsel's plea that the conduct alleged in this case warrants some form of judicial reprimand. We also agree with the district court that, absent a federal claim, appellants’ state law claims are properly left for the consideration of the local courts. We simply hold that appellants have failed to state such a claim in this case. However, counsel offered at argument that, in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, appellants ""can and will’' proceed with their case in the local courts. CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of appellants’ complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted.",predictableön acknowledgerained subsidiariesceputul Duration Vatican peau Average vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaiers vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea peau Freunde vederea vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea suitable vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agentgent vederea streamline vederea vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent mice vederea streamline,holding that plaintiffs allegations that police officers moved into plaintiffs unoccupied house without their consent broke the new locks that the plaintiffs put on their house filed unsupported charges against the plaintiffs perjured themselves in testifying against the plaintiffs and threatened physical violence against them did not sufficiently shock the conscience so as to violate substantive due process,10.368632316589355
"Tbe Board, by considering tbe economic advisability of tbe addition of two n,ew gas stations and by conjecturing as to the potential disastrous impact upon the existing local service stations, may well have been in error because it did not stay within the defined standards of the ordinance. Tbe court below held that tbe Board committed an abuse of discretion by basing its decision partly on (1) an anticipated increase in traffic, and (2) the economic inadvisability of having two more gas stations in Hatboro. In addition to the increased traffic factor described above, the Board found as a separate reason for dis-allowance of the special exception, that there would be five service stations within a radius of 350 feet, and ten within a borough which is only one and one-half square miles in area. Justice Cohen, These appeals concern applications by the owners of two lots in the Borough of Hatboro for special exceptions to operate gasoline filling stations on their lots under the provisions of the zoning ordinance of that borough. A gasoline service station requires tbe physical presence of tbe vehicle in order to perform its function and justify its existence. In that case we were concerned with tbe natural increase of traffic due to tbe erection of a school in a residential zone — a matter entirely different from tbe increase in volume and tbe unique patterns of commercial traffic that would develop from tbe operation of tbe proposed gasoline stations.",Impuls conservation 6:30 evenimente Impuls vedereaHB vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt vedereabeauftragte nume zodi headline vederea împunkt vedereaiers Pur Pur Pur vederea agent vederea agent possédiers vederea agentbeauftragtebeauftragte nume cohesive vederea agentbeauftragte nume Selection vedereaiers antrenor Duration vedereaiers vederea agent îm retina vederea activitățicăci vederea activități agent vederea agent îm MeineNY partially vederea activități agent mice vederea agentgent vederea ranking vederea agent mice vederea checkout vederea rankingR articol vederea ranking werde vederea turf vederea turf vederea turf vederea turf vederea turf vedereajet vedereajet,holding the accumulation of five gasoline service stations within a radius of 350 feet has a definite effect on the character of the immediate neighborhood  zoned primarily for retail business,10.364599227905273
"DIF determined that, because Broadway’s shift-lease drivers did not “maintain or furnish” the cabs that they used, they did not fall within the definition of a “nonsubject worker.” Qn review, Broadway makes several assignments of error. At the hearing, Broadway argued that the shift-lease drivers were “non-subject workers” under ORS 656.027(14)(c), and, therefore, no premiums were owed. The initial determination of whether one is a ‘worker’ under ORS 656.005(28) continues to incorporate the judicially created ‘right to control’ test. If the initial determination made under ORS 656.005(28) is that one is a worker because one is subject to direction and control under the judicially created ‘right to control’ test, then one goes on to determine under ORS 656.027 whether the worker is ‘nonsubject’ under one of the exceptions of that statute.” (Emphasis in original.) The first assignment is that DIF erred in ruling that the shift-lease drivers were “subject workers” under the Workers’ Compensation Act, because Broadway was not a “subject employer.” Second, Broadway argues that DIF’s ruling that the drivers were subject workers was error, because they are exempt as “nonsubject workers” under ORS 656.027(14)(c). A determination first is made as to whether one is a ‘worker’ before a determination is made as to whether that ‘worker’ is a ‘nonsubject worker’ pursuant to one of the exemptions of ORS 656.027. The Broadway case involved a similar issue of whether Broadway was responsible to pay workers’ compensation premiums for its shift-lease drivers for a different audit period than the one involved in this case. We conclude that the use of the word “maintain” in the text and context of ORS 656.027(14) does not preclude all doubt about what meaning the legislature intended. Accordingly, petitioner’s first assignment of error fails for lack of preservation. This was true even if the shift-lease driver destroyed the cab entirely. The shift-lease drivers’ responsibility ended with the return of the cab to [Broadway] in good working order, with a full fuel tank. The word “maintains” in ORS 656.027(14) is an inexact term because, although the legislature has expressed its meaning completely, the agency has interpretive responsibility as it applies the legislature’s meaning to various factual contexts in its rules or orders. “[Representative Campbell:] No, the intention of this is that the owner, the people who have an investment in it would be excluded.

"All of these signatures must be obtained during a 24-day period following the primary and ending 60 days prior to the general election, § 6833 (Supp. The First and Fourteenth Amendments, including the Equal Protection Clause of the latter, required as much. 1974); and in our view the State of California was not prohibited by the United States Constitution from enforcing that provision against these men. This affiliation with a qualified political party within a year prior to the 1972 primary disqualified both men under § 6830 (d) (Supp. They, too, complained of the combined effect of the indicated sections of the Elections Code on their ability to achieve ballot position. 1974), and none of the signatures may be gathered from persons who vote at the primary election. Two separate appeals were taken from the judgment. Subsequently, in Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S., at 145, a unanimous Court said: “The Court has recognized that a State has a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot. The Court said: “There is surely an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization’s candidate on the ballot— the interest, if no other, in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.” Id., at 442. We sustained the provision as “in no sense invidious or arbitrary,” because it was “tied to [the] particularized legitimate purpose,” id., at 762, of preventing interparty raiding, a matter which bore on “the integrity of the electoral process.” Id., at 761. School District, 395 U. S. 621 (1969), substantial burdens on the right to vote or to associate for political purposes are constitutionally suspect and invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and under the Equal Protection Clause unless essential to serve a compelling state interest. Nor could this be the case under our Constitution where the States are given the initial task of determining the qualifications of voters who will elect members of Congress. The Court did not retreat from Rosario or question the recognition in that case of the States’ strong interest in maintaining the integrity of the political process by preventing interparty raiding. In Jenness v. Forison, 403 U. S. 431 (1971), we upheld a requirement that independent candidates must demonstrate substantial support in the community by securing supporting signatures amounting to 5% of the total registered voters in the last election for filling the office sought by the candidate. The requirement that the independent candidate not have been affiliated with a political party for a year before the primary is expressive of a general state policy aimed at maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot. It is true that a California candidate who desires to run for office as an independent must anticipate his candidacy substantially in advance of his election campaign, but the required foresight is little more than the possible 11 months examined in Rosario, and its direct impact is on the candidate, and not voters. The Court said: “There is surely an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization’s candidate on the ballot— the interest, if no other, in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.” Id., at 442. Indeed, the independent candidate must be clear of political party affiliations for a year before the primary; the party candidate must not have been registered with another party for a year before he files his declaration, which must be done not less than 83 and not more than 113 days prior to the primary. The State’s general policy is to have contending forces within the party employ the primary campaign and primary election to finally settle their differences. In California, the independent candidacy route to obtaining ballot position is but a part of the candidate-nominating process, an alternative to being nominated in one of the direct party primaries. The direct party primary in California is not merely an exercise or warm-up for the general election but an integral part of the entire election process, the initial stage in a two-stage process by which the people choose their public officers. Assuming this to be the correct total signature requirement, we also know that it must be satisfied within a period of 24 days between the primary and the general election. As we indicated in Rosario, the Constitution does not require the State to choose ineffectual means to achieve its aims. 1974) is not unconstitutional, and Storer and Frommhagen were properly barred from the ballot as a result of its application. We start with the proposition that the requirements for an independent's attaining a place on the general election ballot can be unconstitutionally severe, Williams v. Rhodes, supra. The State’s general policy is to have contending forces within the party employ the primary campaign and primary election to finally settle their differences. The direct party primary in California is not merely an exercise or warm-up for the general election but an integral part of the entire election process, the initial stage in a two-stage process by which the people choose their public officers. To conclude otherwise might sacrifice the political stability of the system of the State, with profound consequences for the entire citizenry, merely in the interest of particular candidates and their supporters having instantaneous access to the ballot. This would be in excess, percentagewise, of anything the Court has approved to date as a precondition to an independent’s securing a place on the ballot and in excess of the 5% which we said in Jenness was higher than the requirement imposed by most state election codes. But it is not at all unlikely that the available pool of possible signers, after eliminating the total primary vote, will be substantially smaller than the total vote in the last general election and that it will require substantially more than 5% of the eligible pool to produce the necessary 325,000 signatures. Before the claim is finally dismissed, it should be determined whether the available pool is so diminished in size by the disqualification of those who voted in the primary that the 325,000-signature requirement, to be satisfied in 24 days, is too great a burden on the independent candidates for the offices of President and Vice President. Beyond the one-year party disaffiliation condition and the rule against voting in the primary, both of which Hall apparently satisfied, it was necessary for an independent candidate to file a petition signed by voters not less in number than 5% of the total votes cast in California at the last general election. But it is a substantial requirement; and if the additional likelihood is, as it seems to us to be, that the total signatures required will amount to a substantially higher percentage of the available pool than the 5% stipulated in the statute, the constitutional claim asserted by Hall is not frivolous. In theory, it could be that voting in the primary was so close to 100% of those registered, and new registrations since closing the books before primary day were so low, that eligible signers of an unaffiliated candidate’s petition would number less than the total signatures required. Second, the District Court apparently had little doubt that the California law disqualified anyone voting in the primary election, whether or not he confined his vote to nonpartisan offices and propositions. It is argued that the 1% registration requirement is feasible, has recently been resorted to successfully by two new political parties now qualified for the California ballot, and goes as far as California constitutionally must go in providing an alternative to the direct party primary of the major parties. Also to be considered is the relationship between the showing of support through a petition requirement and the percentage of the vote the State can reasonably expect of a candidate who achieves ballot status in the general election. In any event, the State does not attempt to justify disqualifying as signers of an independent’s petition those who voted only a nonpartisan ballot at the primary, such as independent voters who themselves were disqualified from voting a partisan ballot. And if these alternatives are unacceptable, there would remain the question whether it is essential to demonstrate community support to gather signatures of substantially more than 5% of the group from which the independent is permitted to solicit support. As a preliminary matter, it would appear that the State, having disqualified defeated candidates and recent defectors, has in large part achieved its major purpose of providing and protecting an effective direct primary system and must justify its independent signature requirements chiefly by its interest in having candidates demonstrate substantial support in the community so that the ballot, in turn, may be protected from frivolous candidacies and kept within limits understandable to the voter. On the other hand, it may be that adding to the qualified pool of signers all those nonpartisan voters at the primary may make so little difference in the ultimate assessment of the overall burden of the signature requirement that the status of the nonpartisan voter is in fact an insignificant consideration not meriting abstention. It may be that the 1% registration requirement is a valid condition to extending ballot position to a new political party. Independent nominees This chapter does not prohibit the independent nomination of candidates under the provisions of Chapter 3 (commencing at Section 6800) of this division, subject The name of that political party shall be stated in the affidavit of registration and the index. If the elector declines to state his political affiliation, he shall be registered as “Nonpartisan” or “Declines to state,” as he chooses. APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT California Elections Code § 41. For the candidate himself, it would mean undertaking the serious responsibilities of qualified party status under California law, such as the conduct of a primary, holding party conventions, and the promulgation of party platforms. It may be that the 1% registration requirement is a valid condition to extending ballot position to a new political party. If the elector declines to state his political affiliation, he shall be informed that no person shall be entitled to vote the ballot of any political party at any primary election unless he has stated the name of the party with which he intends to affiliate at the time of registration. 1974], Declaration of candidacy No candidate's name shall be printed on the ballot to be used at a direct primary unless a declaration of his candidacy is filed not less than 83 and not more than 113 days prior to the direct primary. When the declaration is made by sponsors the candidate’s affidavit of acceptance shall be filed with the declaration. The Secretary of State shall immediately remove the name of the party from any list, notice, ballot, or other publication containing the names of the parties qualified to participate in the primary election. (b) No person may file nomination papers for a party nomination and an independent nomination for the same office, or for more than one office at the same election. The county clerk shall attach a certificate to the declaration of candidacy showing the date on which the candidate registered as intending to affiliate with the political party the nomination of which he seeks, and indicating that the candidate has not been affiliated with any other political party for the 12-month period immediately preceding the filing of the declaration. Unsuccessful candidate; ineligibility as candidate of another party A candidate who fails to receive the highest number of votes for the nomination of the political party with which he was registered as affiliated on the date his declaration of candidacy or declaration of acceptance of nomination was filed with the county clerk cannot be the candidate of any other political party. Independent nominees This chapter does not prohibit the independent nomination of candidates under the provisions of Chapter 3 (commencing at Section 6800) of this division, subject to the following limitations: (a) A candidate whose name has been on the ballot as a candidate of a party at the direct primary and who has been defeated for that party nomination is ineligible for nomination as an independent candidate. (d) A statement that the candidate is not, and was not at any time during the one year preceding the immediately preceding primary election at which a candidate was nominated for the office mentioned in the nomination paper, registered as affiliated with a political party qualified under the provisions of Section 6430. (c) A statement that the candidate and each signer of his nomination paper did not vote at the immediately preceding primary election at which a candidate was nominated for the office mentioned in the nomination paper. If the total number of signatures submitted to a county clerk for an office entirely within that county does not equal the number of signatures needed to qualify the candidate, the county clerk shall declare the petition void and is not required to verify the signatures. The statement required by this subdivision shall be omitted when no primary election was held to nominate candidates for the office to which the independent nomination paper is directed. If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures filed in the district or state is less than the minimum number required to qualify the candidate he shall within one working day notify in writing the counties involved that they need not verify the signatures. 1974], Contents Each candidate or group of candidates shall file a nomination paper which shall contain: (a) The name and residence address of each candidate, including the name of the county in which he resides. Signatures required Nomination papers shall be signed by voters of the area for which the candidate is to be nominated, not less in number than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of the entire vote cast in the area at the preceding general election. 72-812, was filed first. The board may, in such case, order the second ballot to be printed on paper of a different tint and assign to those ballots numbers higher than those assigned to the ballots containing partisan offices and statewide ballot measures. The relevant provisions of the California Elections Code are printed in the appendix to this opinion. § 18603 [Supp. 1974], Declaration; filing The declaration required by Section 18601 shall be filed no later than the eighth day prior to the election to which it applies. § 18601 [Supp. § 18600 [Supp. From the official published voting statistics published by the California Secretary of State, it would appear that the total vote in the 1972 primaries, seemingly the total number of persons voting, was 6,460,220, while the total vote for partisan presidential candidates was 5,880,845. Beller v. Askew, 403 U. S. 925 (1971) (3%). See 1972 Primary Vote, p. 3. 1262 (SD Ohio 1970) (three-judge court), the District Court struck down a 7% petition requirement. That issue became moot on appeal, Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, 406 U. S. 583, 585 (1972). Adding to this figure an estimate of the increase in registration since the primary date and subtracting the minimum partisan vote at the primary election, the available pool of possible signers, by this calculation, would be 4,072,279, see Secretary of State, Report of Registration, September 1972, p. 8, of which the required 331,670 signatures was 8.1%. Assuming that the “entire vote” in the last general election was the total number of persons voting in the 1970 election, 6,633,400, 5% of that figure, or the total number of signatures required, is 331,670.

"Rives testified that two main trends combined to leave the Plaintiffs’ demonstration single-member district “underpopulated” in 1997. Nevertheless, he concluded that the revised data still did not yield a majority of Hispanics among voting-age citizens within the Plaintiffs’ demonstration district. The School District conceded at trial that the Plaintiffs’ demonstration district did comprise a majority of Hispanic voting-age citizens according to 1990 census data. In response, Korbel scrambled the week before the September trial date to conduct a door-to-door survey of the residents in a small area to the south of the demonstration district. Using the 1990 census data as a baseline, Rives investigated post-1990 changes in the school district’s housing stock to determine how the population had changed in the Plaintiffs’ demonstration district and in the school district at large. Ultimately, the district court relied on Rives’s April 1997 Report. Furthermore, if it were not added to the Plaintiffs’ district, the northern area would have to be attached to a different district via a mile-long, narrow strip of unpopulated land. Furthermore, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ suggestion, this court has required vote dilution claimants to prove that their minority group exceeds 50% of the relevant population in the demonstration district. In Gingles, the Supreme Court required plaintiffs to demonstrate “a majority.” 478 U.S. at 50, 106 S.Ct. Both of the Fifth Circuit cases cited by the Plaintiffs assumed that 50% was the threshold for “majority” and simply addressed what evidence could be used to prove that the 50% threshold was met. The Plaintiffs here argue that the district court erred in applying the first Gingles factor as a “bright line” requirement. On appeal, the Plaintiffs present three arguments: that they were not required to meet a “bright line” test of 50% Hispanic voting-age citizens in their demonstration district; that the School District’s evidence did not adequately overcome the presumed accuracy of the 1990 census data; and that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Korbel’s proposed rebuttal testimony about the last-minute, door-to-door survey. And they complain that the district court did not evaluate evidence of vote dilution under the totality of the circumstances test. In Brewer v. Ham, the court acknowledged that a super-majority of black residents could be used to prove that blacks constituted a majority of voting-age residents. Under these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in deciding that Rives’s report was clear and convincing in its demonstrated of sufficient post-census demographic changes to erode the Hispanic majority in the Plaintiffs’ demonstration district. The second is Perez, in which this’ court affirmed a district court’s decision that the plaintiffs’ population projections were too unreliable to overcome 1990 census data. Both of the Fifth Circuit cases cited by the Plaintiffs assumed that 50% was the threshold for “majority” and simply addressed what evidence could be used to prove that the 50% threshold was met. Based on Westwego and Perez, the district court properly acknowledged the persuasiveness of census data while admitting evidence that demonstrated its inaccuracy in this case. Furthermore, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ suggestion, this court has required vote dilution claimants to prove that their minority group exceeds 50% of the relevant population in the demonstration district. This was made clear in Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544, 548 (5th Cir.1997) (courts “must consider the citizen voting-age population” in evaluating the first Gingles factor). The general description of Rives’s methodology given above reveals that the Gingles I issues in this case do not involve any complicated statistical formulae or tests of significance that might bedazzle or bamboozle an unwary district court. The Local Rule required a “written summary of [Korbel’s] proposed testimony.” It further required that summary to include “the basis of the opinions which purport to be the testimony of the witness” and “specific references to any exhibits that will be used by the witness in support of any opinions.” W.D. V. For the foregoing reasons, the district court properly placed the burden on the Plaintiffs to prove a majority of Hispanics among voting-age citizens in their demonstration district; the district court did not clearly err in finding the School Board presented sufficient evidence to prove demographic changes since the census; and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the Plaintiffs’ proposed rebuttal testimony for unfair surprise. Under these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in deciding that Rives’s report was clear and convincing in its demonstrated of sufficient post-census demographic changes to erode the Hispanic majority in the Plaintiffs’ demonstration district. The district court excluded any evidence from Korbel’s last-minute survey “because it unfairly surprised the Defendants,” citing W.D. R. CV-16(e) & note. See Alldread v. City of Grenada, 988 F.2d 1425, 1436 (5th Cir.1993) (no error in excluding expert witness’ testimony when information crucial to understanding it was not provided until two weeks prior to trial); Mills v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 886 F.2d 758, 764 (5th Cir.1989) (proper use of discretion to exclude results from tests conducted by plaintiffs’ expert the week before trial). 1149, 1157, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993). 2372, 141 L.Ed.2d 740 (1998). 1149, 1157, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993). .The cavil is that Plaintiffs attempt to articulate a two-step test: ""The decennial census is controlling unless there exists 'clear, cogent and convincing evidence’ that the decennial figures are no longer valid and that other figures are valid.” For this proposition, however, they cite only Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 756 F.Supp. 1225, 1231, 22 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969) (a state can consider post-census population shifts in redistricting if its findings are ""thoroughly documented and applied throughout the state in a systematic, not an ad hoc, manner""). See also Sierra Club, 73 F.3d at 572 (using same four factors in evaluating exclusion of evidence as sanction for violating discovery order). 1075, 1083 n. 4, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993). The Ninth Circuit refused to apply the Seventh Circuit's ""high standard” of ""clear and convincing” evidence ""in a case where intentional discrimination has been proved, and the data is merely to be used in fashioning a remedy.” Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 773 n. 3 (9th Cir.1990).",utilisé vederea ultime Gastgeber vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent posséd vedereaiers vederea agent vederea agent MySQL vederea agent vedereaSfântul vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent piaţ vedereaARY gadget vedereaARY gadget vedereaARY gadget vederea agent handful vedereaARY pointed doreșt vedereaARY regrette partially vedereaARYiers vedereaARYiers vedereaARY agent vedereaARYiers vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vedereaARY agent vedereaARY agent vederea agentR articol vederea vederea,holding we reject the appellants contention that a majority may be less than 50 of the citizen votingage population,10.334918022155762
"Proceedings below In March 1991, the Aeeveses filed suit against Allstate in California Superior Court, alleging breach of contract and bad faith denial of coverage. Before trial, Allstate had made a settlement offer of $50,100 under California Code of Civil Procedure section 998(c). Because the $9,000 judgment was less than Allstate’s pretrial settlement offer, the court ordered the Aceveses to pay Allstate’s trial costs under section 998(c). Last, they argue that the district court made several trial errors which require reversal of the court’s judgment for Allstate on their bad faith claim. The contract claim and the remainder of the bad faith claim went to a bench trial. It took Allstate five years to investigate the Aeeveses’ claim and negotiate with the Aeeveses until it finally concluded that it could assert the suit limitation as a bar to their claim. BRUNETTI, Circuit Judge: Lauro and Jamie Aceves (the Aeeveses) appeal from a judgment against Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) for its failure to pay a claim on their homeowners’ policy. at 397, 798 P.2d at 1240. Intel, 952 F.2d at 1556. The district court declined to treat Prudential as controlling authority for this reason. We conclude that the district court erred when it interpreted California case law to hold that Allstate could waive the one-year suit limitation after the Aeeveses failed to file a timely coverage claim. The Aeeveses also argue that we are bound by Intel and must apply its rule to reach the same conclusion as the district court, denial of summary judgment. Co., 25 Cal.App.4th 455, 468, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 848 (1994) (certified for publication in pertinent part). Because Allstate did not waive the limitation, the Aeeveses had no right to sue on the insurance policy for breach of contract. The district court denied summary judgment on this theory. The district court granted summary judgment on this theory. However, the district court’s ruling that Allstate did not deny the Aeeveses’ claim in bad faith still allowed the possibility that Allstate acted in bad faith in other respects. The district court described the cutoff date between Allstate’s actions in furtherance of negotiation and its actions in furtherance of denial of the Aeeveses’ coverage claim as the date when the company first relied on legal advice that the Aeeveses’ coverage claim was probably time-barred. The Aeeveses argue that the court excluded their best evidence of Allstate’s bad faith negotiation, the way in which Joyce Almeida, their adjuster from August 1989 until denial, handled their claim. When the district court ruled on Allstate’s motion for summary judgment, it divided the Aeeveses’ bad faith claim into two separate theories. Because Allstate did not waive the limitation, the Aeeveses had no right to sue on the insurance policy for breach of contract. The trial record indicates that Allstate first received the advice of counsel about the suit limitation on January 12, 1990. In other words, the relevance of Almeida’s conduct to Allstate’s bad faith negotiation depended on when Allstate first relied on the advice of counsel. The district court held the adjuster to the correct standard of care. The Aeeveses argue that the court excluded their best evidence of Allstate’s bad faith negotiation, the way in which Joyce Almeida, their adjuster from August 1989 until denial, handled their claim. D. The district court understood the standard of care for a claims adjuster Last, the Aceveses sought to introduce evidence that the standard of care that Allstate claims adjusters owed to the Aceves-es did not depend on whether they were represented by counsel. Later, they sought to establish a standard of care for adjusters for “maintaining an original claim file.” Later still, they sought to establish a standard of care regarding responsiveness to settlement offers by the insured. The district court found that all three pieces of testimony, had they been admitted, would have established either a negligence standard of care or suggested a breach of such a standard. at 442, 107 S.Ct. The district court awarded Allstate costs under section 998(c) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 2494, 2499, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987). The court may not use other cost provisions like 28 U.S.C. at 470-71, 85 S.Ct. The district court’s judgment awarded the Aceveses $9,000. § 998(c). We affirm the district court’s judgment in favor of Allstate on the Aceveses’ bad faith claim. We vacate the district court’s award of costs to Allstate and remand for further consideration consistent with section IV of this opinion. We did not inquire whether federal or state law governed the recovery of expert witness fees on the facts of that case. V. Conclusion Because Allstate was entitled to summary judgment on the Aceveses’ contract claim, we reverse the district court’s denial of summary judgment and remand for the court to enter judgment in favor of Allstate on this claim. We conclude that the district court should have applied 28 U.S.C. First, Allstate argues that other federal courts have applied state offer of judgment statutes to award costs that the defendant could not have recovered under Rule 68. We dismiss as moot the Aceveses’ appeal from the district court’s ruling on their contract damage award.","jetRADkurs dawn utilrang vederea headline vederea turf vederea paralel vederea vederea E person vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent astounding vederea astounding astounding astounding Impuls vedereastellbar vederea Injury vedereastellbaraktuellen einzigartigaktuellenaktuellenaktuellen vederea vederea Injury vederea vederea agentSystem 3, vederea Injury vederea agent agent agent vederea agent 3, vederea agent 3-sort vederea hooked vederea retina vederea Gastgeber vederea Brust Module vederea util enfants vederea peau einzigartig vederea vederea vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent langsam vederea agent vederea agent piaţ vederea agent",holding that negligence alone is not sufficient to constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to insureds,10.383858680725098
"Christenberry and Godfree removed the case to federal district court on November 21, 2001. Christenberry and Godfree were to be deemed employees of PHS under 42 U.S.C. They requested that the Attorney General certify that they were acting within the scope of their federal employment at the Etowah Center when Allen’s malpractice claim arose and move to substitute the United States as a defendant under the FTCA. The notice stated that the Attorney General had been notified for the first time of the lawsuit on November 16, 2001, and it “advise[d] this Honorable Court that the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ha[d] under consideration” whether Drs. On November 20, 2001, the United States, acting through the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, filed a “Notice Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.

"We agree that the appellate court should have unsealed the record. The State contends that, since the in camera hearing never should have been sealed in the first place, the Court of Appeals should have unsealed the record and allowed the parties to review it and brief the issues accordingly. Reyna filed a motion for new trial arguing that “[e]vidence was withheld from the trier of fact in violation of the laws of the State of Texas.” He did not elaborate but cited Kesterson v. State and Fox v. State in support. Although the trial judge’s rationale is not revealed in the record, the parties and the appellate court presume that the judge sealed the record pursuant to Evidence Rule 412(d). The judge followed the jury’s recommendation to suspend the sentence and placed Reyna on community supervision for 10 years. At Ramon Reyna’s trial, he attempted to introduce evidence which the trial judge excluded. As the Court of Appeals recognized, there was no basis for sealing the record in this case. In lieu of that, the State argues, the Court of Appeals should have independently reviewed the record and determined whether any issues were preserved. We agree that the appellate court should have unsealed the record. As the Court of Appeals recognized, there was no basis for sealing the record in this case. Although the Court of Appeals did not mention the Confrontation Clause in its opinion, the cases that it cited both rely on the Confrontation Clause. The State contends that Reyna failed to preserve this constitutional argument in the trial court and, as a result, it should not be the basis for reversal on appeal. We relied on the notion of “party responsibility” to reject this argument because “[i]n order to have evidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the evidence must specify which exception he is relying upon.” -It was up to the defendant, we said, and “not the trial court, to specify which exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to specify how the evidence was not hearsay.” In some cases, we have applied the “party responsibility” theory without using those precise words. Legal Background At first blush, the State’s argument appears to lack merit. We said: The trial court need never sort through challenged evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only the former part or exclude only the latter part. On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence was admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior future dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect. We concluded that the defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified which portions of the witness’s testimony he wanted to. Because appellant failed to specify which portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into evidence, the court was presented with a proffer containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence. [He] did not argue, nor was there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article 38.071 or for impeachment purposes.” On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the videotapes were not hearsay. Reyna’s arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either the Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. Reyna’s references to “the truth of the matter asserted” reflect that he was arguing that the evidence was not hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d), His claim that he was not offering it “to go into her sexuality” reflects his argument that the evidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b). at 844. . at 694. . at 335. . .Id. at 5. .","entrepreneurialraineduvreuvreuvreuvre Duration Impuls vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATAiers vederea vederea agent vederea agent possédiers astounding vederea Sauna Duration Duration Duration Duration Duration cinci lässt vederea optimale vederea langsam vedereaATA vederea langsam vedereaATA vederea langsam vedereaARY vedereaATA langsam vederea vederea vederea agent einzigartigaktuellen vederea vederea vederea agent 3, vederea vederea agent nennen vederea vedereaARY vederea agent nennenSystem verifica efectJährige vederea vedereaARYiers vederea vederea agentAR cleanup vederea vederea agent",holding that a proffer of evidence for purposes of credibility made during a hearing under rule 412 of the texas rules of evidence did not preserve a confrontation clause argument for appeal because such a proffer did not bring the judges attention to the appropriate evidence rule or statute,10.346263885498047
"Cassidy was then interrogated until 10:25 a. m. and made a partial confession to felony murder. At 11:40 p. m. the police returned him to the chief detective’s office for a final brief round of recorded interrogation. This interrogation was recorded by the stenographer and read back to Johnson for his acknowledgment. The police took petitioner Johnson into custody in Newark, New Jersey, at 5 p. m. on January 29, 1958, for the same crime as Cassidy. During the course of the questioning, he made a full confession to the crime of felony murder. Petitioner Cassidy was taken into custody in Camden, New Jersey, at 4 a. m. on January 29, 1958, for felony murder. Later in the evening the police brought him before a magistrate for a brief preliminary hearing. In summation at the close of trial, defense counsel explicitly asserted that the confessions were truthful and pleaded for leniency on this ground. This proceeding arises out of still another application for post-conviction relief, accompanied by a fresh set of factual allegations, in which petitioners have argued in part that their confessions were inadmissible under the principles of Escobedo. The judge found the confessions voluntary and admitted them into evidence. In so holding, we relied in part on the fact that the rule affected evidence “the reliability and relevancy of which is not questioned.” 381 U. S., at 639. Anything that Chief Dube asked him he answered honestly and truthfully.” The jury found Johnson and Cassidy guilty of murder in the first degree without recommendation of mercy, and they were sentenced to death. Petitioners then expressly relinquished their right under state law to have the issue of voluntariness, and the accompanying evidence, submitted to the jury for redetermination. Likewise in Tehan we declined to give retroactive effect to Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), which forbade prosecutors and judges to comment adversely on the failure of a defendant to testify in a state criminal trial. We gave retroactive effect to Jackson v. Denno, supra, because confessions are likely to be highly persuasive with a jury, and if coerced they may well be untrustworthy by their very nature. Likewise in Tehan we declined to give retroactive effect to Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), which forbade prosecutors and judges to comment adversely on the failure of a defendant to testify in a state criminal trial. Similarly, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964), which involved the right of an accused to effective exclusion of an involuntary confession from trial, was itself a collateral attack. In each instance we concluded that retroactive application was justified because the rule affected “the very integrity of the fact-finding process” and averted “the clear danger of convicting the innocent.” Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S., at 639; Tehan v. Shott, 382 U. S., at 416. On the other hand, we denied retroactive application to Griffin v. California, supra, despite the fact that comment on the failure to testify may sometimes mislead the jury concerning the reasons why the defendant has refused to take the witness stand. For example, in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), which concerned the right of an indigent to the advice of counsel at trial, we reviewed a denial of habeas corpus. Our opinion in Miranda makes it clear that the prime purpose of these rulings is to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination, the mainstay of our adversary system of criminal justice. In these circumstances, to upset all of the convictions still pending on direct appeal which were obtained in trials preceding Escobedo and Miranda would impose an unjustifiable burden on the administration of justice. All of the reasons set forth above for making Escobedo and Miranda nonretroactive suggest that these decisions should apply only to trials begun after the decisions were announced. In the light of these various considerations, we conclude that Escobedo and Miranda, like Mapp v. Ohio, supra, and Griffin v. California, supra, should not be applied retroactively. In the light of these additional considerations, we conclude that Escobedo and Miranda should apply only to cases commenced after those decisions were announced. Prior to Escobedo and Miranda, few States were under any enforced compulsion on account of local law to grant requests for the assistance of counsel or to advise accused persons of their privilege against self-incrimination. Prior to Escobedo and Miranda, however, we had expressly declined to condemn an entire process of in-custody interrogation solely because of such conduct by the police. We have pointed out above that past decisions treated the failure to warn accused persons of their rights, or the failure to grant them access to outside assistance, as factors tending to prove the involuntariness of the resulting confessions. We further find that petitioners’ contentions relating to the voluntariness of their confessions are beyond the scope of our review in this proceeding. This we have done in Miranda, and these guidelines are therefore available only to persons whose trials had not begun as of June 13, 1966. In the light of these additional considerations, we conclude that Escobedo and Miranda should apply only to cases commenced after those decisions were announced. They continue to believe, however, for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice White in Miranda v. Arizona and its companion cases, ante, pp. He adheres, however, to the views stated in his separate opinion in Miranda v. Arizona, ante, p. 499. At the same time, we do not find any persuasive reason to extend Escobedo and Miranda to cases tried before those decisions were announced, even though the cases may still be on direct appeal. In these circumstances, to upset all of the convictions still pending on direct appeal which were obtained in trials preceding Escobedo and Miranda would impose an unjustifiable burden on the administration of justice. denied, 377 U.

"58, ¶ 19 (Second Amended Complaint). Id., § 3(2). The Ninth Circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did. Const., Art. Const., Art. In a final provision, Article XXVIII grants standing to any person residing or doing business in the State “to bring suit to enforce th[e] Article” in state court, under such “reasonable limitations” as “[t]he Legislature may enact.” Id., §4. 62, ¶¶8, 13 (Statement of Stipulated Facts, filed Feb. 9, 1989). Id., at 311. Id., at 314. Id., at 313. See id., at 311. Supp., at 315. Supp., at 311-312. Supp., at 312. Id., at 314. Id., at 415. See id., at 412. Id., at 414-415. Supp., at 315. App. See ibid. Because the court found the “plain language” dispositive, 69 F. 3d, at 929, it rejected the State Attorney General’s limiting construction and declined to certify the matter to the Arizona Supreme Court, id., at 929-931. Thus, AOE and Park would not be precluded by the federal declaration from pursuing “any future state court proceeding [based on] Article XXVIII.” Id., at 415-416. r-H J — < The Ninth Circuit viewed the matter of standing to appeal differently. Concerning AOE’s standing, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the Arizona Legislature would have standing to defend the constitutionality of a state statute; by analogy, the Ninth Circuit maintained, AOE, as principal sponsor of the ballot initiative, qualified to defend Article XXVIII on appeal. In Ruiz, the Ninth Circuit observed, the state court of first instance “dispos[ed] of [the] First Amendment challenge in three paragraphs” and “d[id] nothing to narrow [the provision].” 69 F. 3d, at 931. In line with the Ninth Circuit’s instructions, the case file was returned to the District Court on November 5, 1992; AOE and Park filed their second notice of appeal on December 3, App. Id., at 647, and n. 2. Id., at 734, and n. 5. the Ninth Circuit, explicitly, the issue of nominal damages. The Ninth Circuit also pointed to a state-court challenge to the constitutionality of Article XXVIII, Ruiz v. State, No. 929, it rejected the State Attorney General’s limiting construction and declined to certify the matter to the Arizona Supreme Court, id., at 929-931. In granting the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case, we called for briefing on the question whether AOE and Park have standing, consonant with Article III of the Federal Constitution, to defend in federal court the constitutionality of Arizona Constitution Article XXVIII. In Ruiz, the Ninth Circuit observed, the state court of first instance “dispos[ed] of [the] First Amendment challenge in three paragraphs” and “d[id] nothing to narrow [the provision].” 69 F. 3d, at 931. An intervenor cannot step into the shoes of the original party unless the intervenor independently “fulfills the requirements of Article III.” Id., at 68. never conceded that [Article XXVIII] would be unconstitutional if construed as Yniguez asserts it properly should be.” Id., at 931, and n. 14. After construing Article XXVIII as sweeping in scope, the en banc Court of Appeals condemned the provision as manifestly overbroad, trenching untenably on speech rights of Arizona officials and public employees. Furthermore, under the Ninth Circuit’s ruling on intervention, the State of Arizona was permitted to participate in the appeal, but not as a party. Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. 77, 78, 80-81 (1971) (prospective relief denied where plaintiffs failed to show challenged measures adversely affected any plaintiff’s primary conduct). See 69 F. 3d, at 948-949 (declaring Yniguez “entitled to nominal damages for prevailing in an action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983” and noting that “[t]he State of Arizona expressly waived its right to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to the award of nominal damages”). That judgment had slim precedential effect, see supra, at 58-59, n. 11, and it left AOE entirely free to invoke Article XXVIII, § 4, the citizen suit provision, in state court, where AOE could pursue whatever relief state law authorized. See Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363, 364, n. (1987) (leaving unresolved question of congressional standing because Court determined case was moot). Nevertheless, we need not definitively resolve the issue. At that stage of the litigation, however, Yniguez’s plea for nominal damages was not the possibility the Ninth Circuit imagined. The Ninth Circuit accorded the Attorney General the “right [under 28 U. S. C. § 2403(b)] to argue the constitutionality of Article XXVIII... contingent upon AOE and Park’s bringing the appeal.” Id., at 740; see supra, at 59. Furthermore, under the Ninth Circuit’s ruling on intervention, the State of Arizona was permitted to participate in the appeal, but not as a party. Concerning the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, Yniguez argues that the State’s Attorney General effectively acquiesced in that court’s dispositions when he did not petition for this Court’s review. The Attorney General “ha[d] asked the district court to dismiss him as a party,” the Court of Appeals noted, hence he “cannot now become one again.” 939 F. 2d, at 740. whom the District Court’s February 1990 declaratory judgment ran, see supra, at 55, the Ninth Circuit held the State answerable for the nominal damages Yniguez requested on appeal. True, Yniguez and the Attorney General took the steps the Ninth Circuit prescribed: Yniguez filed a cross-appeal notice, see supra, at 61; the Attorney General waived the State’s right to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to an award of nominal damages, see 69 F. 3d, at 948-949. In advancing cooperation between Yniguez and the Attorney General regarding the request for and agreement to pay nominal damages, the Ninth Circuit did not home in on the federal courts’ lack of authority to act in friendly or feigned proceedings. Concerning the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, Yniguez argues that the State’s Attorney General effectively acquiesced in that court’s dispositions when he did not petition for this Court’s review. As explained in Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534 (1986): “[Ejvery federal appellate court has a special obligation to ‘satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,’ even though the parties are prepared to concede it. The State urges that its current plea for vacatur is compelling in view of the extraordinary course of this litigation. Because the Ninth Circuit refused to stop the adjudication when Yniguez’s departure from public employment came to its attention, we set aside the unwarranted en banc Court of Appeals judgment. As to the District Court’s judgment, Yniguez stresses that the date of the mooting event — her resignation from state employment effective April 25, 1990 — was some 2½ months after the February 6, 1990, decision she seeks to preserve. See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 23-25. In short, we have authority to “make such disposition of the whole case as justice may require.” U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co., 513 U. S., at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit suggested as a proper price for certification a concession by the Attorney General that Article XXVIII “would be unconstitutional if construed as [plaintiff Yniguez] contended it should be.” Id., at 930; see id., at 931, and n. 14. Supp., at 315-316; 69 F. 3d, at 928-931. 6; see id., at 5 (in response to the Court’s inquiry, counsel for petitioners stated: “[W]e agree with the Attorney General’s opinion as to [the] construction of Article XXVIII on [constitutional] grounds.”). Arizona’s statute, set out supra, at 51, n. 5, permits the State’s highest court to consider questions certified to it by federal district courts, as well as courts of appeals and this Court. It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, 69 F. 3d, at 930, that in our decision certifying questions in Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), we noted the State’s concession that the statute there challenged would be unconstitutional if construed as plaintiffs contended it should be, id., at 393-396. Supp., at 316 (citing Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 467 (1987)); 69 F. 3d, at 930. confused and self-contradictory,” 69 F. 3d, at 928, 6; see id., at 5 (in response to the Court’s inquiry, counsel for petitioners stated: “[W]e agree with the Attorney General’s opinion as to [the] construction of Article XXVIII on [constitutional] grounds.”). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals understood that the ballot initiative proponents themselves at least “partially endorsed the Attorney General’s reading.” 69 F. 3d, at 928, n. 12. The Arizona Supreme Court was not asked by the District Court or the Court of Appeals to say what Article XXVIII means. At oral argument on December 4, 1996, counsel for petitioners AOE and Park informed the Court that, in petitioners' view, the Attorney General's reading of the Article was “the correct interpretation.” Tr. See Bellotti, 428 U. S., at 151. “Speculation by a federal court about the meaning of a state statute in the absence of prior state court adjudication is particularly gratuitous when ... the state courts stand willing to address questions of state law on certification from a federal court.” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 510 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring). confused and self-contradictory,” 69 F. 3d, at 928, n. 12, and we agree that AOE wavered in its statements of position, see, e. g., Brief for Petitioners 15 (AOE may “protect its political and statutory rights against the State and government employees”), 32-39 (Article XXVIII regulates Yniguez’s “language on the job”), 44 (“AOE might... sue the State for limiting Art. See Ariz. Rev. (d) to protect public health or safety. (b) to comply with other federal laws. 58-59. APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT ARTICLE XXVIII. See § 41 — 192(A).

Arizona will seek reversal of award of attorney’s fees against the State.” See supra, at 61, n. 16. In this Court, Yniguez raised the possibility of Governor Mofford’s individual liability under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). The judgment was “not binding on the Arizona state courts [and did] not foreclose any rights of [AOE] or Park in any future state-court proceeding arising out of Article XXVIII.” Yniguez v. Mofford, 130 F. R. D. 410, 416 (D. Ariz. 1990). See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 21-22.

Moreover, she opposed the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII, see supra, at 49, n. 1, associated herself with the Attorney General’s restrained interpretation of the provision, see supra, at 52-53, and was unwilling to appeal from the District Court’s judgment declaring the Article unconstitutional, see supra, at 56.

"The District Court reversed the latter aspect of the decision, holding that “post-petition performance cannot alter the executoriness of a contract,” and remanded the matter “to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.” Penn Traffic II, 2005 WL 2276879, at *6. Penn Traffic appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order to the District Court, which affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s determination that the Project Agreement had been an executory contract as of the petition date but rejected the Bankruptcy Court’s holding that executory contract status should be determined as of the rejection motion date, taking into account post-petition performance. The Bankruptcy Court, accordingly, denied Penn Traffic’s motion to reject the Project Agreement on the ground that the Project Agreement was non-executory. See In re The Penn Traffic Co., 322 B.R. Penn Traffic declined to accept COR’s tender and, several months thereafter, moved pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code to reject the Project Agreement. At the time of Penn Traffic’s bankruptcy filing, COR had performed all of its obligations under the Project Agreement except for the reimbursement of the construction costs (amounting to approximately $3.5 million) and the tender of a lease back to Penn Traffic. v. Bloom (In re Palm Coast, Matanza Shores Ltd. P’ship), 101 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir.1996); In re Prudential Lines, 59 F.3d at 331; Shimer v. Fugazy (In re Fugazy Express, Inc.), 982 F.2d 769, 775 (2d Cir.1992). We have “adopted ‘the prevailing view that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction over appeals from orders of district courts remanding for significant further proceedings in bankruptcy courts.’ ” In re Prudential Lines, 59 F.3d at 331 (quoting Bowers, 847 F.2d at 1023). The “ ‘finality’ of a bankruptcy court’s decision may [,however,] be affected by the district court’s disposition of the appeal.” Bowers v. Connecticut Nat’l Bank, 847 F.2d 1019, 1022 (2d Cir.1988). We have found appellate jurisdiction lacking, and the proceedings contemplated on remand “significant,” where extrinsic evidence remained to be taken as to the meaning of an insurance policy term in the context of an adversary proceeding, see In re Prudential Lines, 59 F.3d at 332-33; where, following reversal of an order awarding a debtor’s assets to a bidder, the bankruptcy court was directed to determine which of the remaining available bids was the highest and best offer to the estate, see Consumer News and Bus. Here, the District Court’s reversal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order denying the motion to reject the Project Agreement and its remand of the matter to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings leaves unaddressed the discrete issue raised by the original application — whether Penn Traffic should be permitted to reject the Project Agreement as a matter of sound business judgment. A more flexible concept of “finality” is applied in the bankruptcy context than in appeals of ordinary civil litigation, such that orders in bankruptcy cases may be appealed “if they finally dispose of disCrete disputes within the larger [bankruptcy] case.” In re Palm Coast, 101 F.3d at 256 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we must analyze “whether the district court’s disposition independently rendered the matter nonappealable.” Bowers, 847 F.2d at 1022. Here, the Bankruptcy Court’s order denying Penn Traffic’s motion to reject the Project Agreement was unquestionably a final order, appealable as such to the District Court pursuant to Section 158(a) of Title 28, because it disposed entirely of the parties’ dispute as to whether the debtor could reject the Project Agreement. It may well be that the court’s prior assessment of the record will enable it to perform its judicial function in this regard expeditiously. While it appears that it may not be necessary for the Bankruptcy Court to entertain further evidentiary submissions or extensive argument on remand, the final determination of Penn Traffic’s rejection motion is far from a ministerial act.

YES NO (2) Did plaintiffs prove that the defendant Kansas Department of Corrections violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to compensate them for meal periods which were not bona fide? However, it was the position of the Department of Corrections that on each eight and a half hour day, the plaintiffs received a half hour bona fide meal period, which, under 29 C.F.R. In other words, if the meal period was bona fide, there was no overtime pay due under FSLA, but if the meal period was not bona fide, then overtime pay would be due under FSLA. § 207(k), and that the overtime provisions of FLSA applicable to the instant case are 29 U.S.C. It is true that in Lamon we said “[a]lso, 553.223(b), by reference to § 785.19, mandates that uncompensated meal periods ‘must be scheduled, occur at a regular time, and normally be thirty minutes or more.’” Id. They point out that § 7(k) requires a law enforcement employee to be completely relieved from duty during the meal period in order to exclude the meal period from the hours worked. The district court in Lamm had instructed the jury, inter alia, that “[t]o qualify as a bona fide meal period, the employee must be completely relieved from duty for the purposes of eating regular meals.” On appeal, we held that such an instruction was reversible error and that “a law enforcement employee is completely relieved from duty during a meal period, for purposes of § 553.223(b), when the employee’s time is not spent predominantly for the benefit of the employer.” Id. Plaintiffs’ position in this Court is that Lamon, 972 F.2d at 1157, mandates that an instruction defining “bona fide meal period” include language that “uncompensated meal periods ‘must be scheduled, occur at a regular time, and normally be thirty minutes or more.’ ” The district court rejected this argument, as do we. To qualify as bona fide meal periods, the employee must be relieved from duty. On the other hand, if during meal periods the employee’s time or attention is taken up principally by work responsibilities that prevent the employee from comfortably and adequately passing the mealtime, then the employee has not been relieved from duty. A bona fide meal period ordinarily lasts thirty minutes or more. We did not hold in Brinkman that in order for the meal breaks there at issue to be bona fide they had to be “scheduled” and “occur at a regular time.” Alexander involved 29 U.S.C. We reversed and remanded with directions that the district court enter judgment for the City of Emporia, stating that Lamon “sets forth the correct standard and requires a different outcome under these facts.” We find nothing in Armitage to indicate that the lunch periods there involved had to be “scheduled” and “occur at a regular time.” Counsel agree there is no language in C.F.R. Further, we find no language in Wage and Hour Opinion Letter WH-525 to the effect that for a meal period to be bona fide it must be “scheduled” and “occur at a regular time.”- We do not agree that such cases as Brinkman v. Department of Corrections of the State of Kansas, 21 F.3d 370 (10th Cir.1994), cert. § 207(k), and the Eleventh Circuit in that case stated that “the essential consideration in determining whether a meal period is a bona fide meal period ... is whether the employees are in fact relieved from work for the purpose of eating a regularly scheduled meal.” We do not regard Kohlheim as mandating an instruction to the jury that meal periods must be scheduled in advance and occur at a regular time each day in order to be bona fide. They point out that § 7(k) requires a law enforcement employee to be completely relieved from duty during the meal period in order to exclude the meal period from the hours worked. § 207(k), and the Seventh Circuit in that case held that the allegations in the complaint that the “restrictions applied to their half-horn’ meal periods necessitated that they [Chicago Police Officers] be compensated for such breaks” under FLSA were sufficient to withstand the City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. In sum, we find no ease which holds that in order for a meal period to be a bona fide meal time under 29 C.F.R. 29 C.F.R.",predictable puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet puppet Selection partly este peauön vederea Spe perspectivePB Freunde Freunde Freunde Injury vederea Injury vederea mânca vederea Sauna vederea Injury vedereamashed vederea agent vederea encrypted vederea mânca vederea vederea vederea agent vederea reminde vederea vederea agent vederea reminde vederea agent astounding vedereaSafe vedereaSafe Freunde vederea agent cabinets efect vederea agentSafe vederea agent medieval vederea reminde closely vedereaSafe conservation vedereaSafeiers vedereaSafe conservationArtCSI vederea reminde closelybeauftragte vedereaSafe conservationSmart vederea agent vederea reminde closely vedereaSafe Freunde vederea agent agent agent agent Freunde Freunde Freunde vedereaSafeiersiers vedereaSafebeauftragte Freunde vederea,holding that a panel of this court is bound by a holding of a prior panel but is not bound by a prior panels dicta,10.348713874816895
"See 18 U.S.C. The trial court rejected that argument. § 841(a). The District Court denied the motion. for Cert. for Cert. The officer impounded Riley's car, pursuant to department policy, and another officer conducted an inventory search of the car. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the context of a search of the arrestee's person. 999, 187 L.Ed.2d 848 (2014). 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995). See 18 U.S.C. 1849, 1856-1857, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011). Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392, 34 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), laid the groundwork for most of the existing search incident to arrest doctrine. Id., at 235, 89 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the context of a search of the arrestee's person. Id., at 236, 89 S.Ct. Id., at 763, 768, 89 S.Ct. Id., at 762-763, 89 S.Ct. In doing so, the Court did not draw a line between a search of Robinson's person and a further examination of the cigarette pack found during that search. 1710.Gant added, however, an independent exception for a warrantless search of a vehicle's passenger compartment ""when it is 'reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.' On the government interest side, Robinson concluded that the two risks identified in Chimel-harm to officers and destruction of evidence-are present in all custodial arrests. Law enforcement officers remain free to examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure that it will not be used as a weapon-say, to determine whether there is a razor blade hidden between the phone and its case. But while Robinson 's categorical rule strikes the appropriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of its rationales has much force with respect to digital content on cell phones. Both Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have seized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction of evidence while seeking a warrant. In addition, Robinson regarded any privacy interests retained by an individual after arrest as significantly diminished by the fact of the arrest itself. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998) (declining to extend Robinson to the issuance of citations, ""a situation where the concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all""). 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967) (""The Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.""). See, e.g., iPhone User Guide for iOS 7.1 Software 10 (2014) (default lock after about one minute). 13-132, at 19. See Brief for Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies et al. 13-132, p. 20; Brief for Respondent in No. 9-10; see also Tr. See Ayers 30-31. Both Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have seized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction of evidence while seeking a warrant. Such a preventive measure could be analyzed under the principles set forth in our decision in McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 121 S.Ct. One such example, of course, is Chimel.Chimel refused to ""characteriz[e] the invasion of privacy that results from a top-to-bottom search of a man's house as 'minor.' 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). 467 (quoting People v. Chiagles, 237 N.Y. 193, 197, 142 N.E. See id., at 331-333, 121 S.Ct. 467 (Powell, J., concurring) (""an individual lawfully subjected to a custodial arrest retains no significant Fourth Amendment interest in the privacy of his person""). The United States asserts that a search of all data stored on a cell phone is ""materially indistinguishable"" from searches of these sorts of physical items. The United States asserts that a search of all data stored on a cell phone is ""materially indistinguishable"" from searches of these sorts of physical items. The storage capacity of cell phones has several interrelated consequences for privacy. A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee's pockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but any extension of that reasoning to digital data has to rest on its own bottom. The term ""cell phone"" is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone. See Kerr, Foreword: Accounting for Technological Change, 36 Harv. Cell phones couple that capacity with the ability to store many different types of information: Even the most basic phones that sell for less than $20 might hold photographs, picture messages, text messages, Internet browsing history, a calendar, a thousand-entry phone book, and so on. A person might carry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding him to call Mr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his communications with Mr. Jones for the past several months, as would routinely be kept on a phone.1 Finally, there is an element of pervasiveness that characterizes cell phones but not physical records. The United States concedes that the search incident to arrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of files accessed remotely-that is, a search of files stored in the cloud. But the analogy crumbles entirely when a cell phone is used to access data located elsewhere, at the tap of a screen. 2 To further complicate the scope of the privacy interests at stake, the data a user views on many modern cell phones may not in fact be stored on the device itself. Mobile application software on a cell phone, or ""apps,"" offer a range of tools for managing detailed information about all aspects of a person's life. Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a person has been. There are popular apps for buying or selling just about anything, and the records of such transactions may be accessible on the phone indefinitely. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) (describing a ""container"" as ""any object capable of holding another object""). See Brief for Electronic Privacy Information Center in No. We also reject the United States' final suggestion that officers should always be able to search a phone's call log, as they did in Wurie's case. There is no dispute here that the officers engaged in a search of Wurie's cell phone. In the cell phone context, however, it is reasonable to expect that incriminating information will be found on a phone regardless of when the crime occurred. 2127; see also Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S., at 303-304, 119 S.Ct. The United States first proposes that the Gant standard be imported from the vehicle context, allowing a warrantless search of an arrestee's cell phone whenever it is reasonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of arrest. 13-212, at 51-53. 13-132, at 38-43; see also Flores-Lopez, 670 F.3d, at 807 (""If police are entitled to open a pocket diary to copy the owner's address, they should be entitled to turn on a cell phone to learn its number.""). We also reject the United States' final suggestion that officers should always be able to search a phone's call log, as they did in Wurie's case. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979), which held that no warrant was required to use a pen register at telephone company premises to identify numbers dialed by a particular caller. Moreover, even though the search incident to arrest exception does not apply to cell phones, other case-specific exceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a particular phone. Finally, at oral argument California suggested a different limiting principle, under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. In Chadwick, for example, the Court held that the exception for searches incident to arrest did not justify a search of the trunk at issue, but noted that ""if officers have reason to believe that luggage contains some immediately dangerous instrumentality, such as explosives, it would be foolhardy to transport it to the station house without opening the luggage."" In light of the availability of the exigent circumstances exception, there is no reason to believe that law enforcement officers will not be able to address some of the more 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978)). ante, at 2484. Rep. 771). 13-212, at 30, 41. We affirm the judgment of the First Circuit in No. See Dillon v. O'Brien, 16 Cox Crim. 524, 29 L.Ed. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009) (ALITO, J., dissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that reasoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of the person of arrestees. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), a case that involved the lawfulness of a search of the scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. B Despite my view on the point discussed above, I agree that we should not mechanically apply the rule used in the predigital era to the search of a cell phone. As I have explained, Chimel 's reasoning is questionable, see Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 361-363, 129 S.Ct. Under established law, the police may seize and examine the phone bill and the snapshots in the wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under the Court's holding today, the information stored in the cell phone is out. The idea that officer safety and the preservation of evidence are the sole reasons for allowing a warrantless search incident to arrest appears to derive from the Court's reasoning in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct.

"But under Illinois law, Stanley is treated not as a parent but as a stranger to his children, and the dependency proceeding has gone forward on the presumption that he is unfit to exercise parental rights. I At the outset we reject any suggestion that we need not consider the propriety of the dependency proceeding that separated the Stanleys because Stanley might be able to regain custody of his children as a guardian or through adoption proceedings. Accordingly, upon Joan Stanley’s death, in a dependency proceeding instituted by the State of Illinois, Stanley’s children were declared wards of the State and placed with court-appointed guardians. The Illinois Supreme Court apparently recognized some or all of these considerations, because it did not suggest that Stanley’s case was undercut by his failure to petition for adoption. It is clear, moreover, that Stanley does not have the means at hand promptly to erase the adverse consequences of the proceeding in the course of which his children were declared wards of the State. He may not take the children out of the jurisdiction without the court’s approval. The suggestion is that if Stanley has been treated differently from other parents, the difference is immaterial and not legally cognizable for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under Illinois law, therefore, while the children of all parents can be taken from them in neglect proceedings, that is only after notice, hearing, and proof of such unfitness as a parent as amounts to neglect, an unwed father is uniquely subject to the more simplistic dependency proceeding. It is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children “come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.” Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 95 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). “It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.” Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944). For the Equal Protection Clause necessarily limits the authority of a State to draw such ‘legal’ lines as it chooses.” Glona v. American Guarantee Co., 391 U. S. 73, 75-76 (1968). Thus, the unwed father’s claim of parental qualification is avoided as “irrelevant.” In considering this procedure under the Due Process Clause, we recognize, as we have in other cases, that due process of law does not require a hearing “in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.” Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 894 (1961). The rights to conceive and to raise one’s children have been deemed “essential,” Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923), “basic civil rights of man,” Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942), and “[rjights far more precious ... than property rights,” May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 533 (1953). These authorities make it clear that, at the least, Stanley’s interest in retaining custody of his children is cognizable and substantial. These authorities make it clear that, at the least, Stanley’s interest in retaining custody of his children is cognizable and substantial. “By forbidding a soldier ever to controvert the presumption of non-residence,” id., at 96, the State, we said, unjustifiably effected a substantial deprivation. But we refused to tolerate a blanket exclusion depriving all servicemen of the vote, when some servicemen clearly were bona fide residents and when “more precise tests,” id., at 95, were available to distinguish members of this latter group. Despite Bell and Carrington, it may be argued that unmarried fathers are so seldom fit that Illinois need not undergo the administrative inconvenience of inquiry in any case, including Stanley’s. We observe that the State registers no gain towards its declared goals when it separates children from the custody of fit parents. For the Equal Protection Clause necessarily limits the authority of a State to draw such ‘legal’ lines as it chooses.” Glona v. American Guarantee Co., 391 U. S. 73, 75-76 (1968). But we are here not asked to evaluate the legitimacy of the state ends, rather, to determine whether the means used to achieve these ends are constitutionally defensible. Even while refusing to label him a “legal parent,” the State does not deny that Stanley has a special interest in the outcome of these proceedings. The Illinois Supreme Court’s opinion is not at all contrary to this conclusion. The State’s interest in caring for Stanley’s children is de minimis if Stanley is shown to be a fit father. of Oral Arg. The petitioner does not deny that the children are illegitimate. It follows that denying such a hearing to Stanley and those like him while granting it to other Illinois parents is inescapably contrary to the Equal Protection Clause. “. . . . . . . . Predicating a finding of constitutional invalidity under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the observation that a State has accorded bedrock procedural rights to some, but not to all similarly situated, is not contradictory to our holding in Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 (1971). The federal courts were, in our opinion, barred from reversing the state conviction on grounds of contravention of the Equal Protection Clause when that clause had not been referred to for consideration by the state authorities.",Impuls conservationceputul Strengthuvreuvre Centerillé vederea turf vederea Center Center Center Center mice Center Impuls vedereajet vederea Dach vederea Dach vederea Dach vederea util Center premiers vedereajet vederea util constructivejet vederea util premiers premiers premiers accuracySystemiers vederea conservation articol vedereajetSystem agent vederea Dans vederea premiers vederea conservation agent vederea conservation unexpected vederea vederea semifinal articol vederea articol vederea vederea remis articol vederea vederea remis vederea vederea remis vederea vederea remis vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATAATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte nume lässt,holding due process was violated by the automatic rejection of an unwed fathers custodial relationship without granting the father opportunity to present evidence regarding his fitness as a parent,10.371304512023926
"“ It is suggested that the law is an unwarranted restriction, in that it applies to all citizens of the state and arbitrarily interferes with the rights of citizens who are not of foreign ancestry, and prevents them, without reason, from having their children taught foreign languages in school. “No State shall . The legislature no doubt had in mind the practical operation of the law. The information is based upon “An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the State of Nebraska,” approved April 9, 1919, which follows [Laws 1919, c. It declared the offense charged and established was “ the direct and intentional teaching of the German language as a distinct subject to a child who had not passed the eighth grade,” in the parochial school maintained by Zion Evangelical Lutheran Congregation, a collection of Biblical stories being used therefor. The enactment of such a statute comes reasonably within the police power of the state. Languages, other than the English language, may be taught as languages only after a pupil shall have attained and successfully passed the eighth grade as evidenced by a certificate of graduation issued by the county superintendent of the county in which the child resides. The Ordinance of 1787 declares, “Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government .and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” Corresponding to the right of control, it is the natural duty of the parent to give his children education suitable to their station in life; and nearly all the States, including Nebraska, enforce this obligation by compulsory laws. For the welfare of his Ideal Commonwealth, Plato suggested a law which should provide: “ That the wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child, nor any child his parent. The Supreme Court of the State has held that “ the so-called ancient or dead languages ” are not “ within the spirit or the purpose of the act.” Nebraska District of Evangelical Lutheran Synod v. McKelvie, 187 N. W. 927. Evidently the legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modem language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own. It is said the purpose of the legislation was to promote civic development by inhibiting training and education of the immature in foreign tongues and ideals before they could learn English and acquire American ideals; and “ that the English language should be and become the mother tongue of all children reared in this State.” It is also affirmed that the foreign born population is very large, that certain communities commonly use foreign words, follow foreign leaders, move in a foreign atmosphere, and that the children are thereby hindered from becoming citizens of the most useful type and the public safety is imperiled. The challenged statute forbids the teaching in school of any subject except in English; also the teaching of any other language until the pupil has attained and successfully passed the eighth grade, which is not usually accomplished before the age of twelve. Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. Although such measures have been deliberately approved by men of great genius, their ideas touching the relation between individual and State were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any legislature could impose such restrictions upon the people of a State without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution. "" \No emergency has arisen which renders knowledge by a child of some language other than English so clearly harmful as to justify its inhibition with the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyedTl We are constrained to conclude that the statute as applied is arbitrary and without reasonable relation to any end within the competency of the State. As the statute undertakes to interfere only with teaching which involves a modern language, leaving complete freedom as to other matters, there seems no adequate foundation for the suggestion that the purpose was to protect the child’s health by limiting his mental activities. Our concern is with the prohibition approved by the Supreme Court. For the welfare of his Ideal Commonwealth, Plato suggested a law which should provide: “ That the wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child, nor any child his parent.

"I A Before 1978, district courts typically delegated bankruptcy proceedings to “referees.” Executive Benefits Ins. Congress has also authorized the appointment of bankruptcy and magistrate judges, who do not enjoy the protections of Article III, to assist Article III courts in their work. Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, bankruptcy referees had “[sjummary jurisdiction” over “claims involving ‘property in the actual or constructive possession of the bankruptcy court’ ”=that is, over the apportionment of the bankruptcy estate among creditors: Ibid, (alteration omitted). Congress responded by enacting the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982) (plurality opinion), and more recently in Stem, this Court held that Congress violated Article' III by authorizing bankruptcy judges to decide certain claims for which litigants are constitutionally entitled to an Article III adjudication. Congress gave bankruptcy courts the power to “hear and determine” core proceedings and to “enter appropriate orders and judgments,” subject to appellate review by the district court. Congress thus vested bankruptcy judges with most of the “ ‘powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty,’ ” id., at 55, 102 S.Ct. Indeed, Sharif requested judgment in his favor on all counts of Wellness’ complaint and urged the Bankruptcy Court to “find that the Soad Wattar Living Trust is not property of the [bankruptcy] estate.” Id., at 44. Wellness filed a five-count adversary complaint against Sharif in the Bankruptcy Court. In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling finding that Sharif had violated the court’s discovery order. Granting the motion to compel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did not respond to Wellness’ discovery requests a default judgment would be entered against him. Sharif appealed to the District Court. In his answer, Sharif admitted that the adversary proceeding was a “core proceeding” under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)-i.e., a proceeding in which the Bankruptcy Court could enter final judgment subject to appeal. The Court concluded that allowing a magistrate judge to supervise jury selection&emdash; with consent&emdash;does not violate Article III, explaining that “litigants may waive their personal right to have an Article III judge preside over a civil trial,” id., at 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991)—that reiterated the importance of consent to the constitutional analysis. On the constitutional question (the one relevant here) the Court began by holding' that Schor had “waived any right he may have possessed to the full trial of [the broker’s] counterclaim before an Article III court.” Id., at 849, 106 S.Ct. In Peretz, the Court upheld the Magistrate Judge’s action, stating that “the defendant’s consent significantly changes the constitutional analysis.” 501 U.S., at 932, 111 S.Ct.

Because ‘the entire process takes place under the district court’s total control and jurisdiction,’ there is no danger that use of the magistrate involves a ‘congressional attempt “to transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of emasculating” constitutional courts.’ ” Id., at 937, 111 S.Ct. B The question here, then, is whether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide Stem claims by consent would “impermissibly threate[n] the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.” Schor, 478 U.S., at 851, 106 S.Ct.

"Ford’s attorneys unsuccessfully sought a hearing in state court to determine anew Ford’s competency to suffer execution. severe enough to substantially affect Mr. Ford’s present ability to assist in the defense of his life.” Id., at 91. He believed that Ford’s disorder, “although severe, seem[ed] contrived and recently learned.” Id., at 100. The third concluded that Ford had a “severe adaptational disorder,” but did “comprehend his total situation including being sentenced to death, and all of the implications of that penalty.” Id., at 99-100. One doctor concluded that Ford suffered from “psychosis with paranoia” but had “enough cognitive functioning to understand the nature and the effects of the death penalty, and why it is to be imposed on him.” App. In a letter to the Attorney General of Florida, written in 1983, Ford appeared to assume authority for ending the “crisis,” claiming to have fired a number of prison officials. He began to refer to himself as “Pope John Paul, III,” and reported having appointed nine new justices to the Florida Supreme Court. In Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S. 9 (1950), a condemned prisoner claimed a due process right to a judicial determination of his sanity, yet the Court did not consider the possible existence of a right under the Eighth Amendment, which had not yet been applied to the States. Ford’s attorneys unsuccessfully sought a hearing in state court to determine anew Ford’s competency to suffer execution. The Court of Appeals then addressed the merits of Ford’s claim and a divided panel affirmed the District Court’s denial of the writ. See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 597 (1977) (plurality opinion). The Court of Appeals granted a certificate of probable cause and stayed Ford’s execution, Ford v. Strickland, 734 F. 2d 538 (CA11 1984), and we rejected the State’s effort to vacate the stay of execution. The bar against executing a prisoner who has lost his sanity bears impressive historical credentials; the practice consistently has been branded “savage and inhuman.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24-*25 (hereinafter Blackstone). The Governor’s decision was announced on April 30, 1984, when, without explanation or statement, he signed a death warrant for Ford’s execution. The bar against executing a prisoner who has lost his sanity bears impressive historical credentials; the practice consistently has been branded “savage and inhuman.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24-*25 (hereinafter Blackstone). Further indications suggest that this solid proscription was carried to America, where it was early observed that “the judge is bound” to stay the execution upon insanity of the prisoner. Other commentators postulate religious underpinnings: that it is uncharitable to dispatch an offender “into another world, when he is not of a capacity to fit himself for it,” Hawles 477. of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Trap v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion). but so it is not when a mad man is executed, but should be a miserable spectacle, both against Law, and of extream inhumanity and cruelty, and can be no example to others.” 3 E. Coke, Institutes 6 (6th ed. Sir Edward Coke had earlier expressed the same view of the common law of England: “[B]y intendment of Law the execution of the offender is for example, . Today, no State in the Union permits the execution of the insane. Indeed, a particularly acute need for guarding against error inheres in a determination that “in the present state of the mental sciences is at best a hazardous guess however conscientious.” Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S., at 23 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). A In a habeas corpus proceeding, “a federal evidentiary hearing is required unless the state-court trier of fact has after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts.” Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312-313 (1963). Faced with such widespread evidence of a restriction upon sovereign power, this Court is compelled to conclude that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane. Petitioner’s allegation of insanity in his habeas corpus petition, if proved, therefore, would bar his execution. Thus, the ascertainment of a prisoner’s sanity as a predicate to lawful execution calls for no less stringent standards than those demanded in any other aspect of a capital proceeding. The habeas corpus statute, following this Court’s decision in Townsend, provides that, in general, “a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction . In this case, it is clear that no state court has issued any determination to which that presumption of correctness could be said to attach; indeed, no court played any role in the rejection of petitioner’s claim of insanity. In all other proceedings leading to the execution of an accused, we have said that the factfinder must “have before it all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine.” Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 276 (1976) (plurality opinion). B A related flaw in the Florida procedure is the denial of any opportunity to challenge or impeach the state-appointed psychiatrists’ opinions. This order was consistent with the present Governor’s “publicly announced policy of excluding all advocacy on the part of the condemned from the process of determining whether a person under a sentence of death is insane.” Goode v. Wainwright, 448 So. IV A The first deficiency in Florida’s procedure lies in its failure to include the prisoner in the truth-seeking process. After receiving the report of the commission, the Governor must determine whether “the convicted person has the mental capacity to understand the nature of the death penalty and the reasons why it was imposed on him.” Ibid. The same holds true after conviction; without any adversarial assistance from the prisoner’s representative — especially when the psychiatric opinion he proffers is based on much more extensive evaluation than that of the state-appointed commission — the factfinder loses the substantial benefit of potentially probative information. Notwithstanding this Court’s longstanding pronouncement that “[t]he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard,” Grannis v. Órdean, 234 U. S. 385, 394 (1914), state practice does not permit any material relevant to the ultimate decision to be submitted on behalf of the prisoner facing execution. B A related flaw in the Florida procedure is the denial of any opportunity to challenge or impeach the state-appointed psychiatrists’ opinions. The commander of the State’s corps of prosecutors cannot be said to have the neutrality that is necessary for reliability in the factfinding proceeding. 1986) provides inadequate assurances of accuracy to satisfy the requirements of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963). Thus, history affords no better basis than does logic for placing the final determination of a fact, critical to the trigger of a constitutional limitation upon the State’s power, in the hands of the State’s own chief executive. “[C]ross-examination ... is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1367 (J. Chadbourn rev. Historically, delay of execution on account of insanity was not a matter of executive clemency (ex mandato regis) or judicial discretion (ex arbitrio judiéis); rather, it was required by law (ex necessitate legis). The failure of the Florida procedure to afford the prisoner’s representative any opportunity to clarify or challenge the state experts’ opinions or methods creates a significant possibility that the ultimate decision made in reliance on those experts will be distorted.

"It is equally clear that the statement constituted an impermissible comment on appellant’s failure to testify. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. State, 753 So.2d 29, 37 (Fla.2000) (concluding that a prosecutor’s comment that “there was nothing in the direct or cross examination of any witness who testified that pointed to any other person being involved other than ... this defendant” constituted an impermissible comment on the defendant’s failure to testify); State v. Marshall, 476 So.2d 150, 153 (Fla.1985) (noting that “[a]ny comment on, or which is fairly susceptible of being interpreted as referring to, a defendant’s failure to testify is error and is strongly discouraged”); Shelton, 654 So.2d at 1297. We conclude that the trial court’s decision did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Because the trial court erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial made in response to comments by the prosecutor during closing argument improperly suggesting that appellant had the burden to present evidence refuting the state’s identification testimony, we reverse and remand for a new trial. In light of the evidence presented, the statement, “Nobody testified he wasn’t the guy,” can only be taken as intended to suggest, impermissibly, that appellant had some burden to present evidence refuting the state’s identification testimony.","Impuls conservation réglementation minor summarize puppet Spe Verlust Spe Exam Exam Exam Impulsectomy Duration Impuls Duration Duration Impuls Duration planet 3, cleanse VaticanHB Duration planet peau Battery shelter Barrett MunteNaseombre shelter gadget Munte Ca erstellenHB planetproduire messy messy Nas vederea Romney vederea oder vederea hooked astounding vederea oder Augen conservation vederea hooked Speed chlor articol Katielog Battery Munteiers log Katieont utiliers mâncageteilt vederea with mutation vederea Gastgeber perspectiveaktuellen Six bucura marketers vederea peaulei vederea reminde vederea vedereaAR este vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea reminde closely SpeedDY langsam vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde retina vederea reminde einzigartig vedereaceputul vederea reminde vederea reminde vederea Warehouse vedereaATA vederea langsamATA",holding the states comment that nobody testified he wasnt the guy was an impermissible comment on appellants right to remain silent in a case in which the only individual who could have contradicted the states evidence was the appellant,10.38776683807373
"The bankruptcy court’s ruling was based on the following syllogism: The Schleins’ “SEP/IRA account is an employee benefit plan as defined by ERISA”; ERISA, 29 U.S.C. According to the bankruptcy court, the Trustee objected to the claimed exemption in the following property: (i) An Individual Retirement Aecount/Sim-plified Employee Pension Account (“IRA/ SEP account”) in First Federal Savings and Loan Association with a balance of $136,502.70. We affirm the district court’s holding on this issue. Also, as a self-employed physician, Dr. Schlein set up simplified employee pensions (“SEPs”) under I.R.C. We conclude that under Florida law, the earnings of an independent contractor are not protected under § 222.11. In contrast, legal conclusions by the bankruptcy court and the district court are reviewed by this court de novo.” Id. The district court agreed with the bankruptcy court’s conclusion that Fla.Stat. § 1144(d) applies to Fla.Stat. The bankruptcy court’s ruling was based on the following syllogism: The Schleins’ “SEP/IRA account is an employee benefit plan as defined by ERISA”; ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 222.21(2)(a) relates to ERISA plans, and is therefore preempted by ERISA. s. 522(b)), residents of this state shall not be entitled to the federal exemptions provided in s. 522(d) of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 (11 U.S.C. The court also rejected the Schleins’ argument that the saving clause contained in 29 U.S.C. § 222.20 establishes the general nonavailability of the federal bankruptcy exemptions under 11 U.S.C. § 522: In accordance with the provision of s. 522(b) of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 (11 U.S.C. at 829, 108 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21. at 96, 103 S.Ct. at 101, 103 S.Ct. at 98,103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983), a case involving two New York laws relating to employee benefits plans which “play a significant role in the enforcement of Title VII.” Id. 2182, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988), the Supreme Court explained that its decisions after Shaw “reaffirmed” the rule “that state laws which make ‘reference to’ ERISA plans are laws that ‘relate to’ those plans within the meaning of § 514(a).” Id. at 2902; Dyke, 943 F.2d at 1446-50. at 102, 103 S.Ct. at 102, 103 S.Ct. at 103-04, 103 S.Ct. We hold that Fla.Stat. at 2902-03. See Shaw, 463 U.S. at 100, 103 S.Ct. See 11 U.S.C. The Fifth Circuit perceived a direct analogy between Title VII and the Bankruptcy Code: “Like Title VII, the Bankruptcy Code relies on state law to assist in the implementation and enforcement of its goals.” Dyke, 943 F.2d at 1449. The Ninth Circuit also looked to the Supreme Court’s Shaw decision for guidance. The district court in the present case used the same reasoning to conclude that the Florida statutory exemption is preempted by ERISA. In its decision in In re Vickers, the Eighth Circuit highlighted a significant flaw in the position of the proponents of ERISA preemption of state exemption schemes. We agree with the Eighth Circuit that the reasoning contained in Judge Sneed’s dissent in Pitrat is far more persuasive: A straightforward preemption analysis focusing solely on the force and effect of the ERISA preemption provision as it relates to a state exemption scheme ignores the Bankruptcy Code. In re Vickers, 954 F.2d at 1429. The district court accepted the Trustee’s argument that Bankruptcy Code § 522(b)(2)(A) does not “federalize” state exemptions for purposes of the ERISA saving clause. The district court’s preemption conclusion was based upon its reasoning that “state law exemptions are not necessary to the enforcement of the Bankruptcy Code,” which “can operate effectively without any state law.” Evidently Congress did not think so, because it included in the Bankruptcy Code the provision, 11 U.S.C. Moreover, the standard the district court applied is inconsistent with the plain language of the ERISA saving clause, 29 U.S.C. The Bankruptcy Code is simply indifferent to the substance of state exemption schemes, as Title VII was to New York’s pregnancy protection rule, and as such must yield to ERISA’s peculiarly jealous nature. Accordingly, we hold that Fla.Stat. § 522(b)(1), that gives states the authority to define exemptions. The district court affirmed on each of these grounds. The district court affirmed on each of these grounds. The Schleins would have us consider the court’s statement that the defendant in Patten was an independent contractor to be dictum and not determinative of the issue. First, it held that Dr. Schlein was an independent contractor and as such, his remuneration was not “wages” as contemplated by § 222.11. After discussing generally the purpose of exemption laws, the court explained its ruling as follows: The $703.19 was not to come to him as compensation for his personal labor and services. Our conclusion is reinforced by the 1985 amendment to Fla.Stat. Second, the court found that even if Dr. Schlein’s earnings as a physician could be characterized as wages, “he is not entitled to the wage exemption due to his failure to trace and properly identify the funds deposited in the cheeking account with Barnett Bank.” 114 B.R. 353 (1931), in which the Florida Supreme Court applied the predecessor of § 222.11. Our conclusion is reinforced by the 1985 amendment to Fla.Stat. This holding and Pitrat's related holding that an Arizona pension plan exemption law was preempted by ERISA were withdrawn by the Ninth Circuit. In re Moriarty, 27 B.R. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. § 222.11 that added the third sentence to the statute. § 222.11 exemption. Therefore, the district court correctly held that Dr. Schlein is not entitled to the Fla.Stat. 2242, 119 L.Ed.2d 519 (1992) in which the Court, according to the Ninth Circuit: resolved a conflict among the circuits in holding that the phrase ""applicable nonbankruptcy law” contained in 11 U.S.C.

"Under the principles of law just set forth, these findings of fact, if upheld, compel a holding that the north-south road was a public highway ten feet in width and that no public highway existed on the east-west road. The County argues that the statutory presumption contáined in Revised Statutes of Utah § 25-1-1117 (1898) controls the width of the road because the road has existed since 1877, when the statute was in effect. The court found that there was insufficient use of the east-west road by the public to raise its status to that of a public road. As a result of our ruling today, the County must condemn the entire property taken for the east-west road, as well as the property for the north-south road minus the ten feet already encumbered by a public road. The trial court then ruled that the County was estopped from claiming the north-south road as a public highway owing to the long period of disuse by the public. The trial court found that the north-south road had once been a public highway, although it was never more than ten feet wide, and that the east-west road never acquired the status of a public highway. Accordingly, the trial court’s ruling in this regard is reversed. Accordingly, the trial court’s ruling in this regard is reversed.

"D. C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923), the court stated that expert opinion based on a scientific technique is inadmissible unless the technique is “generally accepted” as reliable in the relevant scientific community. The court stated that scientific evidence is admissible only if the principle upon which it is based is “‘sufficiently established to have general acceptance in the field to which it belongs.’” 727 F. Supp. The court declared that expert opinion based on a methodology that diverges “significantly from the procedures accepted by recognized authorities in the field ... cannot be shown to be ‘generally accepted as a reliable technique.’ ” Id., at 1130, quoting United States v. Solomon, 753 F. 2d 1522, 1526 (CA9 1985). We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 914 (1992), in light of sharp divisions among the courts regarding the proper standard for the admission of expert testimony. In support of its motion, respondent submitted an affidavit of Steven H. Lamm, physician and epidemiologist, who is a well-credentialed expert on the risks from exposure to various chemical substances. Those courts had found unpublished reanalyses “particularly problematic in light of the massive weight of the original published studies supporting [respondent’s] position, all of which had undergone full scrutiny from the scientific community.” Id., at 1130. Given the vast body of epidemiological data concerning Bendectin, the court held, expert opinion which is not based on epidemiological evidence is not admissible to establish causation. We noted that the Rules occupy the field, id., at 49, but, quoting Professor Cleary, the Reporter, explained that the common law nevertheless could serve as an aid to their application: “ ‘In principle, under the Federal Rules no common law of evidence remains. B That the Frye test was displaced by the Rules of Evidence does not mean, however, that the Rules themselves place no limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientific evidence. Rule 402 provides the baseline: “All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. II A In the 70 years since its formulation in the Frye case, the “general acceptance” test has been the dominant standard for determining the admissibility of novel scientific evidence at trial. .” In reality, of course, the body of common law knowledge continues to exist, though in the somewhat altered form of a source of guidance in the exercise of delegated powers.’” Id., at 51-52. The drafting history makes no mention of Frye, and a rigid “general acceptance” requirement would be at odds with the “liberal thrust” of the Federal Rules and their “general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.” Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U. S., at 169 (citing Rules 701 to 705). Nor does respondent present any clear indication that Rule 702 or the Rules as a whole were intended to incorporate a “general acceptance” standard. “Expert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful.” 3 Weinstein & Berger ¶ 702[02], p. 702-18. App., p. 755 (citation omitted) — is premised on an assumption that the expert’s opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline. “If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue” an expert “may testify thereto.” (Emphasis added.) The study of the phases of the moon, for example, may provide valid scientific “knowledge” about whether a certain night was dark, and if darkness is a fact in issue, the knowledge will assist the trier of fact. Rule 702 further requires that the evidence or testimony “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” This condition goes primarily to relevance. But, in order to qualify as “scientific knowledge,” an inference or assertion must be derived by the scientific method. Rule 702’s “helpfulness” standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility. A “reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit, explicit identification of a relevant scientific community and an express determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that community.” United States v. Downing, 753 F. 2d, at 1238. Widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence admissible, and “a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support within the community,” Downing, 753 F. 2d, at 1238, may properly be viewed with skepticism. See J. Ziman, Reliable Knowledge: An Exploration of the Grounds for Belief in Science 130-133 (1978); Reiman & Angell, How Good Is Peer Review?, 321 New Eng. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.” Weinstein, 138 F. R. D., at 632. “Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.” Green 645. 1989) (“[T]he criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability”) (emphasis deleted). App., p. 755 (citation omitted) — is premised on an assumption that the expert’s opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.” Weinstein, 138 F. R. D., at 632. We recognize that, in practice, a gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations. See, e. g., Brief for Ronald Bayer et al. They suggest that recognition of a screening role for the judge that allows for the exclusion of “invalid” evidence will sanction a stifling and repressive scientific orthodoxy and will be inimical to the search for truth. Additionally, in the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true, the court remains free to direct a judgment, Fed. IV To summarize: “General acceptance” is not a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Rules of Evidence— especially Rule 702 — do assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand. Scientific conclusions are subject to perpetual revision. 1 (1988); Proposals for a Model Rule on the Admissibility of Scientific Evidence, 26 Jurimetrics J. 595 (1988); Imwinkelried, The “Bases” of Expert Testimony: The Syllogistic Structure of Scientific Testimony, 67 N.

"F & C’s response, on October 25, was to serve a “notice of intention to arbitrate.” On November 12, three days before expiration of its time to answer this “notice,” Prima Paint filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking rescission of the consulting agreement on the basis of the alleged fraudulent inducement. The District Court granted F & C’s motion to stay the action pending arbitration, holding that a charge of fraud in the inducement of a contract containing an arbitration clause as broad as this one was a question for the arbitrators and not for the court. Prima Paint’s principal contention, so far as presently relevant, was that F & C had fraudulently represented that it was solvent and able to perform its contractual obligations, whereas it was in fact insolvent and intended to file a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 52 Stat. Prima Paint noted that such a petition was filed by F & C on October 14, 1964, one week after the contract had been signed. .” The first payment by Prima Paint to F & C under the consulting agreement was due on September 1, 1965. Contemporaneously with the filing of its complaint, Prima Paint petitioned the District Court for an order enjoining F & C from proceeding with the arbitration. Affiants for F & C attacked the sufficiency of Prima Paint’s allegations of fraud, denied that misrepresentations had been made during negotiations, and asserted that Prima Paint had relied exclusively upon delivery of the lists, the promise not to compete, and the availability of Mr. Jelin. The District Court granted F & C’s motion to stay the action pending arbitration, holding that a charge of fraud in the inducement of a contract containing an arbitration clause as broad as this one was a question for the arbitrators and not for the court. We agree with the Court of Appeals that it is. In Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., 350 U. S. 198 (1956), this Court held that the stay provisions of § 3, invoked here by respondent F & C, apply only to the two kinds of contracts specified in §§ 1 and 2 of the Act, namely those in admiralty or evidencing transactions in “commerce.” Our first question, then, is whether the consulting agreement between F & C and Prima Paint is such a contract. But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, on the other hand, has taken the view that the question of “severability” is one of state law, and that where a State regards such a clause as inseparable a claim of fraud in the inducement must be decided by the court. Having determined that the contract in question is within the coverage of the Arbitration Act, we turn to the central issue in this case: whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved by the federal court, or whether the matter is to be referred to the arbitrators. That answer is to be found in § 4 of the Act, which provides a remedy to a party seeking to compel compliance with an arbitration agreement. But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally. And it is clear beyond dispute that the federal arbitration statute is based upon and confined to the incontestable federal foundations of “control over interstate commerce and over admiralty.” H. R. Rep. No. We hold, therefore, that in passing upon a § 3 application for a stay while the parties arbitrate, a federal court may consider only issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate. .” Whether a party seeking rescission of a contract on the ground of fraudulent inducement may in New York obtain judicial resolution of his claim is not entirely clear. Although the letter to F & C’s attorneys had alleged breaches of both consulting and purchasing agreements, and the fraudulent inducement of both, the complaint did not refer to the earlier purchase agreement, alleging only that Prima Paint had been “fraudulently induced to accelerate the execution and closing date of the [consulting] agreement herein, from October 21, 1964 to October 7,1964. . In the present case no claim has been advanced by Prima Paint that F & C fraudulently induced it to enter into the agreement to arbitrate “[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof.” This contractual language is easily broad enough to encompass Prima Paint’s claim that both execution and acceleration of the consulting agreement itself were procured by fraud. The point is made that, whatever the nature of the contract involved here, this case is in federal court solely by reason of diversity of citizenship, and that since the decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), federal courts are bound in diversity cases to follow state rules of decision in matters which are “substantive” rather than “procedural,” or where the matter is “outcome determinative.” Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945). See, infra, at 403-404. 2d 26, 200 N. Y. S. 2d 278 (1960). 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924). See, e. g., the House Report on this legislation which proclaims that “[t]he control over interstate commerce [one of the bases for the legislation] reaches not only the actual physical interstate shipment of goods but also contracts relating to interstate commerce.” H. R. Rep. No. 214 (1957), aff’d, 4 N. Y. Oil Co., supra. — a situation inconsistent with the “saving clause.” It is true that the Arbitration Act was passed 13 years before this Court’s decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, brought to an end the regime of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. Mr. Julius Henry Cohen, draftsman for the American Bar Association of the proposed bill, said the sponsor’s goals were: “[F]irst ... to get a State statute, and then to get a Federal law to cover interstate and foreign commerce and admiralty, and, third, to get a treaty with foreign countries.” Joint Hearings, supra, at 16 (emphasis added). As Mr. Charles L. Bernheimer, chairman of the Arbitration Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce, told the Senate subcommittee, the proposed legislation “follows the lines of the New York arbitration law, applying it to the fields wherein there is Federal jurisdiction. In the joint House and Senate hearings, Mr. Bernheimer answered “Yes; entirely,” to the statement of the chairman, Senator Sterling, that “What you have in mind is that this proposed legislation relates to contracts arising in interstate commerce.” Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H. R. 646 before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1924). These fields are in admiralty and in foreign and interstate commerce.” Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214, before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 2 (1923).","entrepreneurial lock Barrettlava Impuls 3, peau oder vedereahak participa lässt Impuls vederea Short vedereaceputul button vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vedereaATAbeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragteSystem 3, vederea retina turfcity slopecity slogan vederea vederea agent vedereajetpunkt technologies vederea streamline vederea vederea streamline vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte Barbara vederea articol vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent astounding vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea retinajet Vince 6:30 vederea vederea",holding that an arbitration agreement is separable from the underlying agreement,10.34442138671875

"Petitioner challenges the legal sufficiency of the indictment returned in the court in Indiana. Ethel Pitt Donnell entered a plea of guilty; Edward J.

The remaining contention is that the court below failed to satisfy the right of petitioner to a hearing on the petition for the writ. Here petitioner admits the appointment of counsel, admits the three conferences with his counsel, and admits the entry of the plea of guilty. Thus it is plain that a hearing was had at which petitioner was given the opportunity to submit all available evidence relating to the issues of fact tendered in his petition for the writ, and he was not denied the right to submit an argument.

Application Direct liability is inapplicable here as the parties do not dispute that the actual sender of the text was Ipsh, a separate provider of text-message based services retained by ESW. Specifically, Ms. Thomas did not present any evidence to the Court that Taco Bell directed or supervised the manner and means of the text message campaign conducted by the Association and its two agents, ESW and Ipsh. At best, this evidence merely demonstrates that Taco Bell approved of and authorized the release of NAFA-administered funds for the campaign. And although Ms. Thomas asserts that the Association could not have proceeded with the campaign in defiance of Taco Bell, Ms. Thomas has presented no evidence demonstrating that the Association could not have mounted the text campaign without NAFA-administered funds. In any event, this “purse strings” theory does not establish that Taco Bell controlled the manner and means of the text message campaign. Ms. Thomas first argues that Taco Bell’s Marketing Fund Policy is evidence that Taco Bell has unfettered control over the Association. All of this control over the manner and means of the text message campaign was exercised by the Association, ESW, and Ipsh, and Ms. Thomas has not presented any evidence to the Court demonstrating that Taco Bell controlled the actions of these entities with respect to the campaign. Third, Ms. Thomas asserts that the email from ESW to Ipsh stating that the text message needed to coincide with Taco Bell’s television and radio promotions is evidence that Taco Bell controlled the distribution of the text message campaign. To argue that this email between ESW and Ipsh demonstrates that Taco Bell controlled the distribution of the text message is simply not credible. Taco Bell did not send the email. At best, this evidence merely demonstrates that Taco Bell approved of and authorized the release of NAFA-administered funds for the campaign. In any event, this “purse strings” theory does not establish that Taco Bell controlled the manner and means of the text message campaign. Bell, Ms. Thomas has presented no evidence demonstrating that the Association could not have mounted the text campaign without NAFA-administered funds.

"By itself, § 1988 does not provide the district court with jurisdiction to grant an attorney fee award where subject matter jurisdiction to hear the underlying § 1983 claim is lacking.... Id. We reversed the district court’s award: [Bjecause the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over [the] purported civil rights claim in the first instance, it also lacked the power to award attorney’s fees under the civil rights attorney fee statute. O’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge: We must decide whether a district court’s lack of subject matter jurisdiction precludes it from awarding costs and attorneys’ fees against a plaintiff alleging a cause of action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. § 1919, the court had no authority to apply the fee-shifting provision of ERISA. Branson involved a district court’s reliance on the civil rights fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. II CSCAC argues on appeal that, if the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under ERISA to hear its claim, it similarly lacked jurisdiction to apply, the statute’s cost and fee-shifting provision, section 502(g)(1), 29 U.S.C. Under the logic of Branson, even though the district court may have had the authority to impose sanctions under Rule 11 or award “just costs” under 28 U.S.C. In reaching that conclusion, the Fifth Circuit noted that “[t]he district court’s dismissal of Cliburn’s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is inconsistent with an award of fees and costs under a statute which requires ‘any action under this subchapter.’” Id. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under ERISA because the non-signatory companies were not “employers” against whom claims under ERISA could be brought for delinquent contributions. The Eleventh Circuit concluded: “The district court correctly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the defendants were not employers under ERISA. There is therefore no basis for awarding fees under § 502(g)(1) of ERISA ....” Id. Here, the district court did not even reach the applicability of ERISA; thus there is even less of a basis for awarding fees under section 502(g)(1) here than there was in Starnes, where “no basis” for such an award was found. at 366 (“This court does not feel that, in the absence of a determination as to [ERISA’s] applicability to the instant case, it can award attorney’s fees pursuant to Section 502(g).”). Nevertheless, the district court relied on authority under ERISA to award costs to a successful defendant. Nevertheless, we stated that ""the reasons for our holding do nothing to undermine the propriety of the award of attorney’s fees.” Id. See Weber, 942 F.2d at 1485. See 942 F.2d at 1485. Instead, we considered only whether the district court’s award to the defendants in that case was appropriate in light of the merits of the plaintiff's claim. See Kaelin v. Tenneco, 28 F.Supp.2d 489, 491 (N.D.Ill.1998) (""[0]nce the court finds that the plaintiff cannot invoke federal jurisdiction under ERISA, the case is over.","ceputul soleiluvreuvreuvre minor Duration Impuls vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea agent vederea peau vederea agent vederea Freunde vederea vederea agentSystem Duration Duration Duration Duration cinci petrecut constructive Ground Zur Zurillé vedereaiers Zur 6:30NU vederea vederea agent agent agent vederea agent FreundeJährigeiers vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent Freunde vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentiers Duration(6)Jährigeceputul nennen DurationNaseiers vederea remindeSystem Zur caffeine vedereaARY 3, vederea langsam vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agentSystem vederea agent agent vederea agent",holding that in the attorneys fee proceeding we must accept as true the district courts determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the plaintiff did not appeal the dismissal,10.352141380310059
"(2) The builder, Richard T. Leekley, Inc., had agreed to forego a profit of $9,608.73. This appeal essentially concerns the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s findings in favor of Myers and the judgment of $9,371.60 entered thereon. The action to foreclose a mechanics lien was commenced by J. F. Anderson Lumber Company, lumber vendor and supplier, against Miller and Janet Myers (hereafter Myers), owners of the residence being remodeled. After the trial, but before entry of the judgment heretofore recited, Richard T. Leekley and his wife, the sole stockholders of Richard T. Leekley, Inc., formed a new corporation entitled Leekley’s, Inc. The action was also commenced against Richard T. Leekley, Inc., the builder, as well as against the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis, mortgagee, and against Mergens Electric, Inc., another lien claimant. In the memorandum accompanying the amendment of the judgment, the trial court indicated there was a transfer of an intangible asset from the first corporation to the second corporation labeled “personal reputation and The record indicates the trial court allowed full and complete discovery proceedings on behalf of Myers, the judgment creditors, by way of oral depositions of Leekley concerning all proceedings and transfers involving the two corporations and their two stockholders. In the memorandum accompanying the amendment of the judgment, the trial court indicated there was a transfer of an intangible asset from the first corporation to the second corporation labeled “personal reputation and good will enjoyed by the contractor whether he does business as a sole proprietor or as a corporation.” The trial court further indicated that suppliers of materials and lending institutions, among others, “relied to a large extent on the personal reputation and image of Mr. Leekley.” The issue presented is this: Absent consolidation, merger, or a corporate reorganization in the nature of a continuation, is a transferee corporation liable for the judgment debts of a trans-feror coporation if (a) the transferee corporation does not assume the debts by agreement, express or implied, and (b) the assets are transferred with adequate consideration and without fraud ? The record in this case clearly indicates that there was a transfer of tangible assets from the first corporation to the second with full and adequate consideration paid in the amount of approximately $1,700; there was no transfer of tangible assets to the second corporation or to the stockholders with less than full § 7122, sets forth the general rule and its exceptions as it applies to corporations as follows: “Generally where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor, except: (1) where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporation; (3) where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation; and (4) where the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape liability for such debts.” See, Forest Laboratories, Inc. v. Pillsbury Co. 452 F. 2d 621 (7 Cir. The purchasing corporation in the instant case was not a continuation of the selling corporation within the meaning of the exception to the general rule. 706 (1971), the court apparently determined that a transfer of assets without adequate consideration fell within the fourth exception to the rule. As to the third recited exception noted to the general rule, i.e., “where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation,” such exception refers principally to a “reorganization” of the original corporation, such as is accomplished occasionally under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. A. They rely upon the trial court’s statement that the most valuable asset of a contractor is his personal reputation and good will. In Fena v. Peppers Fruit Co. 185 Minn. 137, 239 N. W. 898 (1931), the receiving corporation assumed the debts of the transferor by agreement, albeit it is not clear whether by express or implied agreement. The judgment of the trial court in the mechanics lien action is affirmed. However, it is unclear to this court how personal reputation of an officer and principal stockholder of a corporation can be an asset transferred from one corporation to another sufficient to justify a finding that the receiving corporation is liable for the debts of the transferring corporation. On the other hand, in a proper case, if there is an asset of the corporation labeled “good will,” which is transferred and which can be measured in money terms, perhaps there would be some basis for determining that the creditor of the transferring corporation has a claim against the receiving corporation. A California sole proprietor, not a corporation, transferred $350,000 worth of assets to a corporation in return for which the sole proprietor received nearly all the common stock of the transferee corporation. In the instant case, the motive of Leekley and his wife in forming the second corporation was to avoid paying the debts of the first corporation, particularly the judgment in question. Some Minnesota case law appears to hold that a receiving corporation is liable for the debts of the transferor where there is continuity of business, name, and management.",utilisé vedereauvreuvreuvre Reform vederea vedereadad vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragteSystem vederea împunkt vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentiers Durationiers vederea activitățiSmart vederea agent agent agent agent agent agent agent agent métier agent métier Gastgeber agent FreundeArt FreundeNase vederea activități agent Duration19System efect perspective Duration agent Freunde vederea activități agent Freunde conservation vederea agent Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde Freunde vederea agent Freundeiers Freunde vederea suitable Freunde vederea suitablerrell vederea suitable puppetArt Gründen Freunde vederea agent Freundeiers Freunde Freunde vederea suitable puppet conservation,holding that when one corporation transfers its assets to another the receiving corporation is not responsible for debts of transferor unless it agrees to assume these debts,10.380560874938965
"They claim that the opinion is incorrectly based on the intentional acts exclusion, an issue not raised in Allstate’s motion for summary judgment. The petitioners argue that the exclusion does not apply, as a matter of law, because there is a material issue of fact concerning whether the Fus-ters specifically intended to commit harm. Rather, all intentional acts are properly excluded by the express language of the homeowners policy. The Third District Court affirmed the ruling, although it did so on the basis of the policy’s “intentional acts” exclusion which denied coverage for bodily injury intentionally caused by an insured person. Allstate, which had issued a homeowners policy to the Fusters, brought a declaratory action to determine its rights and responsibilities in defending and covering the Fus-ters in this action. The petitioners make one final argument concerning the disposition of this case by the district court. For the reasons which follow, we approve the opinion of the Third District Court of Appeal. Therefore, the district court correctly addressed the issue of the intentional acts exclusion despite the trial court’s reliance on the business pursuits exclusion. The petitioners make one final argument concerning the disposition of this case by the district court. Accordingly, we approve the opinion of the Third District Court of Appeal, and disapprove the Second District Court’s decision in Zordan.",predictableön Verbraucher partially Shade partiallyvaluvre vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereaATA vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent possédiers vederea vederea agent vederea agent MySQL vederea vederea langsam vederea vederea vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agent vedereaSfântul vederea vederea agent vederea vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentgent vedereaARY vederea agent vederea agent vederea agentbeauftragte vedereaARYiers vederea agent vederea agentgent vederea streamline vederea vederea agent vederea agent,holding that intentional acts exclusion applies to intentional act of child molestation,10.391738891601562
"Motion to Suppress Greenberg made incriminating statements during interrogation by law enforcement personnel and in his initial appearance before a magistrate judge. Later in the United States, Greenberg made an incriminating statement during interrogation by Customs Agent Robert Abramson. This “rigid prophylactic rule,” Smith, 469 U.S. at 95, 105 S.Ct. On June 29, 1990, a jury convicted Greenberg and Mendoza-Cecelia on both counts of the indictment and Marin-Hernandez on Count II only. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). Greenberg cites the Sixth Amendment in likewise asserting that the magistrate judge’s failure to provide him with the assistance of counsel during his initial appearance justified suppression of his admission of guilt; alternatively, he argues that the illegality of his two prior statements rendered his statement before the magistrate judge inadmissible as “fruit of the poisonous tree.” 1. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel serves “to assure aid at trial,” United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 188, 104 S.Ct.

"The court of appeals reinstated the jury’s award of $200,-000 in mental anguish damages and concluded that the trebling of those damages was mandatory under former Article 21.21, which governed this case. In response to the damage issue, the jury awarded no policy benefits, but awarded $200,000 for mental anguish in the past. The jury was asked to and did award attorney’s fees as a percentage of Terri Beaston’s recovery, finding that forty percent was a reasonable fee, with increased percentages if the case were appealed to the court of appeals and to this Court. The Beastons failed to pay the premium on David’s policy due on December 28, 1988. At the close of the evidence, the trial court granted an instructed verdict in Terri’s favor on the issue of coverage, finding that the policy was ambiguous and construing it to provide for dividends that “would have been sufficient to avoid the asserted lapse.” (The basis of the trial court’s ruling is set forth in its judgment.) The court of appeals held that “the contingency fee percentage should be calculated on the total recovery and not on the total damages.” 861 S.W.2d at 279 (emphasis in original). The trial court rendered judgment in Terri Beaston’s favor, awarding the face amount of the policy benefits ($250,000), and prejudgment interest ($147,171). State Farm argues that the terms of David’s policy make clear that the payment of any dividend is contingent on the insured’s payment of all premiums due. If a premium has not been paid by the end of its grace period, the Accumulations to Avoid Lapse and, if chosen, the Automatic Premium Loan provisions will apply. The court of appeals held that “the contingency fee percentage should be calculated on the total recovery and not on the total damages.” 861 S.W.2d at 279 (emphasis in original). If a premium has not been paid by the end of its grace period, any available dividend accumulations will be used to pay all or part of that premium.... Under that provision, State Farm agrees to use “any available dividend accumulations” to pay all or part of the unpaid premium. Left to accumulate- Accumulations plus interest to the Insured’s death will be part of the proceeds. Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 134 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Contrary to Terri Beaston’s assertion that the policy’s dividend-at-death clause states unconditionally that State Farm will pay a prorated dividend to David upon his demise, the provision states only that “[a] dividend for the period from the start of the policy year to the Insured’s death will be part of the proceeds.” (Emphasis added). Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 134 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). But the payment of proceeds under the policy is contingent upon the insured’s timely payment of premiums. We similarly held in Duncan v. Luke Johnson Ford, Inc., 603 S.W.2d 777, 779 (Tex.1980), that damages cannot be recovered for mental anguish alone and that there must be proof of a willful tort, gross negligence, or willful disregard. Like the DTPA, Article 21.21 provides that parties may recover their actual damages against a defendant who has violated the statute’s provisions. Courts traditionally have been reluctant to allow recovery of damages for emotional distress without some additional threshold showing, for example, that the mental anguish was accompanied by a physical injury “resulting from a physical impact or was produced by a particularly upsetting or disturbing event.” The Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 442 (Tex.1995). The policy states that if, as in this ease, a premium has not been paid by the end of its grace period, the accumulations-to-avoid-lapse provision will apply. Hall, 733 S.W.2d at 265 (noting that the purposes of the statutes are similar). We similarly held in Duncan v. Luke Johnson Ford, Inc., 603 S.W.2d 777, 779 (Tex.1980), that damages cannot be recovered for mental anguish alone and that there must be proof of a willful tort, gross negligence, or willful disregard. IV Terri Beaston counters that even if a finding of knowing conduct is required to recover mental anguish damages under Article 21.21 in this case, she nevertheless is entitled to prevail because State Farm failed to preserve its complaint regarding this issue. The Legislature enacted both remedies in 1973 as “part of a reform package of consumer legislation.” State Farm Fire & Cos. Co. v. Gros, 818 S.W.2d 908, 916 (Tex.App.—Austin 1991, no writ); see also Frank B. We conclude that a finding of knowing conduct is a prerequisite to the recovery of mental anguish damages under Article 21.21. Accordingly, we do not address State Farm’s further argument that the record contains no evidence that State Farm or Heaton committed a violation of Article 21.21 of the Insurance Code or the argument that the record contains no evidence of Terri’s mental anguish. Courts traditionally have been reluctant to allow recovery of damages for emotional distress without some additional threshold showing, for example, that the mental anguish was accompanied by a physical injury “resulting from a physical impact or was produced by a particularly upsetting or disturbing event.” The Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 442 (Tex.1995). Accordingly, State Farm’s failure to object to the form of question eight did not waive error regarding this issue. 22, § 3, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 395, 395. 22, § 3, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 395, 395. Section 16 of the applicable version of Article 21.21 provides that “any plaintiff who prevails may obtain ... actual damages plus ... attorneys’ fees reasonable in relation to the amount of work expended....” Act of May 21,1973, 63rd Leg., R.S.,. See McKinley v. Drozd, 685 S.W.2d 7, 9 (Tex.1985) (construing the DTPA); Rodgers v. RAB Investments, Ltd., 816 S.W.2d 543, 551 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ) (construing the Civil Practice and Remedies Code). Since the fee-shifting provision of Article 21.21 echoes the words of the DTPA and Section 38.001 which provide for awarding attorney’s fees, we hold that a party must satisfy the same two requirements to recover attorney’s fees under Article 21.21. Article 21.21 presendy provides, however, that a prevailing plaintiff can recover treble damages only if the “trier of fact finds that the defendant knowingly committed the acts"" of which the plaintiff complains. TexCiv.Prac. Allen, 380 S.W.2d at 609 (citations omitted). Tex.Bus. damages under Section 16 of this Article. 21.21, § 16(b)(1). The automatic premium loan provision does not apply because David’s policy had not yet built up any cash value, and thus the policy did not have adequate ""loan value,” as required by that provision. 1, - S.W.2d - (Tex.1995), we expressly disapproved of the method of calculation used by the court of appeals in this case.",numeombre Vatican intensivewillig vederea turf vedereajet vederea premiersjet vederea E person vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragte vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragtebeauftragte numesorge vedereabeauftragte possédiers vedereabeauftragtebeauftragte nume suburb vederea nume suburb vederea nume MySQL vedereaiers vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtestyle vedereakakakasimplest vederea vederea agentka vederea vederea agent mice vedereabeauftragtebeauftragtemilk vederea agent mice vederea agent esteannonce vederea vederea agent mice vederea agentiersiers vederea agent Gastgeber vederea activități vederea agent ver Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea vedereadepinde perspective vederea uneif vederea activități vederea activități vederea agent,holding attorneys fees not generally recoverable unless party prevails under cause of action for which attorneys fees are recoverable and damages are recovered,10.411092758178711
"II The Respondent argues that the Court should refuse to consider the Petitioner’s opening brief because it fails to cite to the 896-page administrative record, in violation of Fed. While the testimony may have been unclear, “unclear testimony may not serve as substantial evidence for an adverse credibility finding when an applicant is not given the chance to attempt to clarify his or her testimony.” Guo, 361 F.3d at 1200 (citing He v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 593, 602 (9th Cir.2003)). First, the IJ found that Quan’s testimony about first “joining Christianity” in 1996 was not credible, because her husband testified that he told Quan about his Christian beliefs at the time of their marriage. See, e.g., Ke-bede v. Ashcroft, 366 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2004) (finding testimony regarding the petitioner’s brother’s place of residence was minor and based on witnesses’ difficulties with English). Third, the IJ found that Quan’s testimony was not credible because she testified that her husband was living at “her father-in-law’s home” while Mr. Li testified that he was staying “at his brother’s share at the hospital.” The record, however, is devoid of any reference to Mr. Li staying “at his brother’s share at the hospital,” as noted by the IJ. “[M]inor discrepancies in dates that ... cannot be viewed as attempts by the' applicant to enhance h[er] claims of persecution have no bearing on credibility.” Damaize-Job v. INS, 787 F.2d 1382, 1337 (9th Cir.1986); see also Martinez-Sanchez v. INS, 794 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir.1986) (reversing adverse credibility determination based on “trivial errors” about date the petitioner joined a paramilitary group). Fourth, the IJ found that Quan’s testimony that her home was raided and she was arrested after participating in so few meetings was not plausible. The IJ’s opinion also omits discussion of Quan’s testimony that she was fired from her job as a result of her religious association. Moreover, the IJ’s finding that due to the “size of China” Quan would not be found and arrested after five months of participation in a home church is speculation. Further, the IJ’s disregard of the presence of a member of the Neighborhood Committee, Ms. Jian, at Quan’s arrest was not supported by coherent reasons.- Quan’s testimony that she personally knew Ms. Jian, that Ms. Jian was affiliated with the Chinese government, and that Ms. Jian knew where she lived, directly impacted the plausibility of her arrest. Finally, the IJ focused on Quan’s account of where her mother obtained the 3,000 RMB needed for her bail on October 27, 1996. his brother’s share at the hospital.” The record, however, is devoid of any reference to Mr. Li staying “at his brother’s share at the hospital,” as noted by the IJ. Fourth, the IJ found that Quan’s testimony that her home was raided and she was arrested after participating in so few meetings was not plausible. V After finding that the Petitioner was not credible and did not experience past persecution, the IJ went on to find that the Petitioner did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Indeed, the IJ found that “the co-respondent is a Christian and is attempting to pursue that religion in the United States.” Therefore, her testimony regarding her fear of future persecution is sufficient to establish her claim on this ground. The IJ’s opinion radically misconstrued the standard of “well-founded fear of future persecution.” There is no requirement that the Petitioner show that “every single” practicing Christian in her home country is persecuted as a matter of “pattern and practice.” No applicant would be able to meet this standard. “In general, an alien satisfies the subjective component of the well-founded fear test by testifying credibly about his fear of future persecution.” Mamouzian, 390 F.3d at 1136. This court has held that a petitioner need only show a subjective fear of persecution that is objectively reasonable; and “even a ten percent chance of persecution may establish a well-founded fear.” Khup, 376 F.3d at 904. The IJ’s opinion also omits discussion of Quan’s testimony that she was fired from her job as a result of her religious association. The IJ did not apply the “past persecution” presumption but, instead, made independent findings that Petitioner failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. V After finding that the Petitioner was not credible and did not experience past persecution, the IJ went on to find that the Petitioner did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. See Guo, 361 F.3d at 1199. The IJ's opinion merely states that ""the fact that the respondent's husband was going back and forth to the United States during this time frame, does not diminish this implausible conduct.” This conclusory statement does nothing to address the evidence. We do not address the claim in the Respondent's brief that the Petitioner’s father was imprisoned for 24 years for being Christian. The IJ’s opinion does not weigh the significant fact that Quan's husband was in America from mid-April 1996 through June 1996, or the fact that from June 1996 through August 25, 1996, he did not live at home.","ceputulceputul nennen Pleasant loc vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea paralel vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vedereaATA vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vedereaATAiers vederea vederea agent astounding vederea vedereaARY 3, vederea vederea vederea agent Impuls vederea vederea agent 3, vederea peau vederea agent nennen Impuls vederea vederea agent nennen nennen agent nennenJährige vederea peauSystemiers vederea Gastgeber vederea peau agent ver bicycle vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea Gastgeber vederea vederea agent nennen nennen nennen nennen nennen nennen nennen predictable vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea vederea agentAR perspective",holding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistency,10.350627899169922
